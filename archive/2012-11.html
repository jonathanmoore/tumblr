<blockquote>
  <p>Repeat after me: big things start small!</p>
  
  <p>If you try to tackle too much in the beginning, you&#8217;ll get overwhelmed. Not only that, but you&#8217;ll lose precious time optimizing your product with too little data. This is, after all, the main reason you should always start with a minimum viable product.</p>

<blockquote><p>It’s not that successful and productive people don’t … feel that same fear—it’s just that most of the good ones have figured out how to either accept the fears as a natural part of the process, or they just choose to ignore each fakey barrier the second it appears.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Ideas Come In Sets</h2>
<p>There is something magical about going to the beach as the sun is rising, just in time for the <a href="http://www.golden-coast.com/surf/dawnpatrol.html" target="_blank">dawn patrol</a>. Even with a wetsuit the air feels crisp and cool, but the moment you step into the water your feet are reminded of just how cold the Pacific is. With a leap onto your board you give yourself a boost as you paddle towards the spot beyond where the waves breaks. Paddling into the first small wave you can&#8217;t help but taste the saltwater.  It&#8217;s a great start to the day.</p>

<p>Now the waiting begins. The water is quiet and peaceful as your board rises and falls over small rolling waves. Scanning the horizon you look for the next set of waves that will take you all the way back to the shore. As the set builds, it&#8217;s tempting take one of the smaller waves for a short ride, but the energy it takes to catch it will either leave you tired or trapped inside the break when the real waves come rolling in.</p>

<p>Occasionally the timing is perfect and you will paddle out just in time for the next set of waves, but more often you&#8217;ll have to watch and wait for the set. When that powerful set wave finally comes in, get ready for a ride of your life.</p>

<p><!-- more --></p>

<hr><h3>Like waves, ideas come in sets.</h3>

<p><strong>You have to get in the water.</strong>  It seems contrary to wait for an idea, but that is because we often think of waiting as a passive state.  The truth is that it takes effort to observe, watch and wait for the idea.  You have to get into the water, surrounding yourself with the very matter that makes up the coming idea.  Being in the water means that you are ready to act on the ideas when they come.  If you are still on the shore or sidelines, you will miss out entirely on the opportunity to act on the ideas.</p>

<p><strong>Patiently watch and let the smaller waves pass you by.</strong>  As ideas begin to form you will start to notice smaller, incomplete ideas of what is to come.  With a lot of effort it&#8217;s entirely possible to catch a smaller idea and act on it, but in doing so you might miss out on the opportunity to ride the oncoming powerful, complete ideas.</p>

<p><strong>When the set waves break, paddle!</strong>  When the full idea is forming, you will clearly see it heading your way.  This is the time when you have to turn around and get to work.  When you are paddling to catch a wave you need to pick up enough speed so that you can match the speed of the coming wave.  It&#8217;s the right balance of timing the idea with <a href="http://jonathanmoore.com/post/35867424576/you-just-have-to-do-something" target="_blank">simply getting started and doing something</a>.  Give it everything you have.</p>

<hr><p>With <a href="http://stylehatch.co" target="_blank">Style Hatch</a> we have seen tremendous success by creating and selling premium themes, but the company is in evolution expanding beyond just themes.  I can start to see the real set waves off towards the horizon.  Although I am not sure exactly what it will look like, I can start to see their shape form in the distance.  For now, I have to remind myself to patiently wait for it to roll in.  Before the idea is about to break, I will be ready to turn around and paddle with everything I&#8217;ve got.</p>

<h2>You Just Have To Do Something</h2>
<p>Throughout life we are impacted with moments that are rich with meaning and significance. Regardless of the joy or sorrow that these moments create, it is our job to listen and respond. This summer I was given the gift of one of those profound moments.</p>
<hr><p>On a warm August afternoon, my wife and I invited some close friends over for lunch to spend the day swimming in our pool. We were in the water playing with our kids, watching them one-up each other jumping in, and playing all the usual games.</p>
<p>One of the times my daughter climbed out to jump back in, she cried out in pain after stepping on a bee. As soon as I pulled out the stinger left behind in her foot, one by one more bees began to swarm. Thinking that the dead bee was attracting others, I picked it up and went inside to throw it away.</p>
<p>The moment I opened the trash in the kitchen I heard my wife scream outside. <em>It wasn&#8217;t an ordinary scream.</em> I look outside right at the moment she was diving into the water. Racing outside I was certain that she was being attacked by the aggressive bees.</p>
<p>I made it to the edge of the water right when she was coming up. My heart sank. In her arms was our little boy, blue and lifeless.</p>
<p><!-- more --></p>
<p>Frantically I took him into my arms as she began to yell for help and call 911. I will never forget what it felt like to hold him in that moment. Laying him on the ground I cried out to God for help. Even though I have never been trained for CPR, instincts on some level kicked in. I started desperately performing a series of chest compressions and breaths. After an eternity of seconds I saw the life and color return to his face. <strong>My boy was saved.</strong></p>
<p>The paramedics arrived shortly after, and within minutes we were on our way to the hospital. During the trip one of the paramedics reassured my wife that he was going to be just fine because CPR was performed right away. After all this was his seventh time to be called out for a drowning this summer, and the only one that did not end in tragedy.</p>
<p>The next day in the ICU, we had a great conversation with the pediatrician. I recounted the entire story, chain of events and explained how I had no clue what I was doing with CPR. He compassionately listened, and then replied, <em>"You don&#8217;t have to do it right. You just have to do something."</em> My boy is alive simply because something was done.</p>
<hr><p>When we are presented with moments of crisis, large decisions or new opportunities often we find ourselves crippled by the lack of knowledge. We justify inaction with our insecurities in not knowing the right way to move forward. Or we trap ourselves in an endless search for knowledge to attempt to reassure our actions.</p>
<p>Over the course of my career and journey as an entrepreneur, I have learned that success and fulfillment is found when we push ourselves beyond our comfort zone. There is tremendous value in having knowledge ahead of time—<em>I am now CPR certified</em>—but simply taking action is often what it takes.</p>
<h4><strong>You don&#8217;t have to do it right. You just have to do something.</strong></h4>

<p>As I sit in the passenger seat of my car today (wife is driving), I am utterly distracted by the countless political yard signs plastered across my city. But what boggles me most, is the candidates absolute failure of differentiation. Every single candidate does the exact same thing and expects to be noticed, understood, and voted for. How stupid is that?</p>

<h2><strong>Cadence</strong></h2>
<p>I have always felt like there are a lot of Tumblr themes that work very well for highly visual blogs full of images and then other themes that work well for long-form articles.  Personally I want to start writing more on my blog, in between the usual posts about creativity, design, photography, and startups.  With that in mind I designed and built our latest premium Tumblr theme Cadence specifically for myself.</p>
<p>Cadence is now <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/theme/36551" target="_blank">for sale on Tumblr</a> for $49.  If you want more details on the responsive layout, two column grid, customization or theme options check out <a href="http://cadence.stylehatch.co/post/35216540142/were-proud-to-introduce-cadence" target="_blank">our introductory post</a> or email us at <a href="http://cadence.stylehatch.co/post/35216540142/were-proud-to-introduce-cadence" target="_blank">cadence@stylehatch.co</a>.</p>

<h2>Hi Jonathan. I just purchased your beautiful &quot;Inspire Well Theme&quot;. The only thing I am confused on how to omit would be the search box. Since I am using your theme for my portfolio I don&#039;t need a search box. Any suggestions? Thank you!</h2>
<p>Thanks for picking up <a href="http://inspirewell.stylehatch.co" target="_blank">Inspire Well</a>!  When I designed and created the theme over two years ago I certainly had it in mind as an option for a portfolio or highly visual blog.</p>
<p>You can add a bit of CSS to the theme to hide the search box.  Go into the Customize menu and under the Advanced drop down paste in the following:</p>
<p><code>.</code><span>search_wrap { display: none; }</span></p>
<p>If you have more questions about Inspire Well send us an email at <a href="mailto:inspirewell@stylehatch.co" target="_blank">inspirewell@stylehatch.co</a>.  During the weekdays we get back to everyone in at least 12 hours, although usually an hour or so, but over the weekend we take a break to spend time with our families.</p>
<p>Also, let us know if you have any suggestions for Inspire Well.  We regularly add new features and improvements to the theme.</p>
