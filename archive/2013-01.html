<h2>The City Series</h2>
<p>Using pieces of cherry, oak, ash, and maple <a href="http://mcnabbstudio.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">James McNabb</a> carefully creates bandsaw cut abstracted architectural forms that he combines in a <a href="http://www.mcnabbstudio.com/city/wheel.html" target="_blank">wheel</a>, <a href="http://www.mcnabbstudio.com/city/table.html" target="_blank">table</a> and <a href="http://www.mcnabbstudio.com/city/sphere.html" target="_blank">sphere</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The City Series is a collection of wood sculptures that represent a woodworker&#8217;s journey from the suburbs to the city. Each piece depicts the outsider&#8217;s perspective of the urban landscape. Made entirely of scrap wood, this work is an interpretation of making something out of nothing. Each piece is cut intuitively on a band saw. The result is a collection of architectural forms, each distinctly different from the next.</p>

<p><strong>An upgrade, years in the making…</strong></p>
<p>When we imagined Tumblr more than seven years ago, we dreamed of offering creators a new canvas. Every post would be a raw look through the author’s eyes and mind. We imagined the interface disappearing as these subjects came to life.</p>
<p>For years, this vision was challenged by limits in browser technology and an increasingly daunting set of Tumblr features to support. But today, we take a huge step.</p>
<p>After months of careful crafting, we’ve reduced <em>creation</em> on Tumblr to its essence, while carrying over <em>every single feature</em> and making room for some BIG new ones (like completely customizable drag-and-drop photoset creation, faster uploads, and inline reblogging!). We can’t wait for you to try it.</p>
<p>The upgrades have started rolling out and will be available for everyone by the end of the weekend. <strong>Most of the bugs and omissions you’ve reported have already been fixed, but please <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/help?form=true" target="_blank">let us know</a> if you run in to any other issues!</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tumblr&#8217;s design, product and engineering team did a fantastic job with this major update to the dashboard.  Finally being able to drag files into Photo posts and rearrange photoset grids is a beautiful thing.</p>

<h2><strong>the event of a thread</strong></h2>

<p><a href="http://pauloctavious.com/" target="_blank">Paul Octavious</a> captures the <em>Ann Hamiltons: the event of a thread</em> art installation created inside the Park Avenue Armory.  Featuring 42 large wood swings moving a massive curtain, flocks of homing pigeons, 42 radios in paper bags, and tables for people to broadcast snippets of text to those radios <em>the event of a thread</em> was probably something better experienced than watched, but Paul&#8217;s video beautifully captures some of the visual experience of the installation.</p>

<h2><a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2013/01/the-cost-of-neutral.html">The Cost of Neutral</a></h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>“If you go to work and do what you&#8217;re told, you&#8217;re not being negative, certainly, but the lack of initiative you demonstrate (which, alas, you were trained not to demonstrate) costs us all, because you&#8217;re using a slot that could have been filled by someone who would have added more value. [&#8230;]</p>
  
  <p>Not adding value is the same as taking it away.”</p>
  
  <p>— Seth Godin</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I could not agree more with <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2013/01/the-cost-of-neutral.html" target="_blank">this post by Seth Godin</a>.  Having people on your team operate at neutral is often more costly than having someone negative on the team.  At least with someone underperforming or negative it&#8217;s clear when you need to part ways, but the neutral team members tend to stay around longer than they should.</p>

<h2><strong>Zonebox</strong></h2>

<p>Over the years I have figured out that I work best in a series of focused sprints.  Some of my most productive days happen when I focus in on a single task for a set amount of time, take a break, and then move on to the next focused task.</p>

<p>This morning I came across <a href="http://rinik.net/zonebox/" target="_blank">Zonebox</a>, a new “timeboxing” app by <a href="http://blog.rinik.net/" target="_blank">Vojtech Rinik</a> that might work really well with my process.  With Zonebox you add a handful of tasks that you&#8217;re working on, give them time limits and then click “focus in”.  The app will give you a countdown and a subtle progress bar at the bottom of your screen so that you know how much longer you have to focus.</p>

<h2>The Icarus Deception</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The old rules: Play it safe. Stay in your comfort zone. Find an institution, a job, a set of rules to stick to. Keep your head down. Don’t fly too close to the sun.</p>
<p>The new truth: It’s better to be sorry than safe. You need to fly higher than ever.</p>
