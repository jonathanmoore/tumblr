<h2>Studio Sweet Studio</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Studio Sweet Studio is a website and yearly publication that features artists, their work, and their workspace as an interesting dialogue about how environment affects creative work and what it means to have a studio as an extension of your “visual brand” as an artist.</p>

<p>I recently stumbled on <a href="http://studio-sweet-studio.com/" target="_blank">Studio Sweet Studio</a> after the founders <a href="http://ghostlyferns.com/" target="_blank">Meg Lewis</a> &amp; <a href="http://tuesdaybassen.net/" target="_blank">Tuesday Bassen</a> started following Style Hatch on twitter last week.  That evening I stayed up going through virtually every post (<em>almost 40</em>) that they have on their two week old site.  The <a href="http://studio-sweet-studio.com/kelly-carambulas-studio/" target="_blank">studio tours</a>, posts on <a href="http://studio-sweet-studio.com/sara-lintners-artcrank-poster-process/" target="_blank">process</a>, and <a href="http://studio-sweet-studio.com/interview-with-jon-ashcroft/" target="_blank">designer interviews</a> are beautifully done and quite inspiring.</p>
<p>Make sure you bookmark this site and add it to your RSS readers.  <strong>It&#8217;s already made it into the list of sites that I check on a daily basis.</strong></p>
