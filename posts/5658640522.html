<h2>Designing for Love—ESPN.com Refresh</h2>
<p>The insanely talented <a href="http://portfolio.tofslie.com/" target="_blank">Edwin Tofslie</a> recently decided to create a<a href="http://portfolio.tofslie.com/#1471241/ESPN-com-Refresh" target="_blank"> full refresh of ESPN.com</a> after getting sick of their dull and outdated site.  Although this was a &#8216;just for the love of design&#8217; project, it&#8217;s a good reminder to take the time to go through similar design exercises to keep your creative mind sharp.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My inspiration really came from ESPN the Magazine. I really believe the merging of magazine layout and website content will continue to blur the lines. I especially believe if I were to tackle this as a real project, it would have to be designed, and built to scale and spider to any platform, in any form. This would allow a specialized iPad version of their site that would mimic a powerful interactive magazine.</p>

<p>After checking out the details and larger images on the <a href="http://portfolio.tofslie.com/#1471241/ESPN-com-Refresh" target="_blank">ESPN.com redesign</a>, spend some time looking at his other projects for Nike, Microsoft, Ford and others.  Don&#8217;t forget to hit refresh a few times to check out his collection of animated GIFs.</p>
<p><em>Now I just need to figure out a site that could use a refresh and do the same.</em></p>
