<p>In what started out as a 18 month tour of Africa after the Berlin wall fell in 1989 turned into a 23 year journey for Gunther Holtorf, his wife and their Mercedes Benz G Wagon named “Otto”.  In total “Otto” has taken them over 500,000 miles (<em>without a breakdown</em>) across almost every continent, to remote islands thanks to freight ships, and even off-limits countries like North Korea, Cuba and Iraq.</p>
