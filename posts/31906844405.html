<p>Often I find myself chasing &#8220;success" in order to find happiness with my work.  Even though I know that the pursuing success or fulfillment in work does not lead to happiness.  With that frame of mind happiness will always be an elusive goal.  I&#8217;ll be happy when&#8230; <em>I land that client, hit this milestone, get that recognition</em>.</p>
<p>As I am preparing for my session at <a href="http://circlesconference.com" target="_blank">Circles Conference</a>, <a href="http://goodthinkinc.com/speakers/shawn-achor/" target="_blank">Shawn Anchor&#8217;s</a> TED talk on The Happy Secret to Better Work is a perfect reminder to reframe my around thinking around happiness and success.  It&#8217;s not our reality that shapes us, but the lens through which we view our reality.</p>
