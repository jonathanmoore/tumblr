<blockquote><p>The goal is not to fix your weaknesses.  The goal is to amplify your strengths and surround yourself with the people who can do what you can&#8217;t do.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Simon Sinek</strong></p>

And it is only when we communicate our beliefs authentically that we can attract others to our cause, and form the bonds that will empower us to achieve truly great things.</p>
