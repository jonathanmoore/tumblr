<h2><a href="http://www.theawl.com/2012/08/grunge-typography">The Rise and Fall of Grunge Typography</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Hop on the nostalgia train for a second. Think back to the 90s. To Nirvana, Linklater’s Slacker, and the flannel-clad rebels on the run from the 80s. To skateboards and graffiti and toe rings and VHS tapes. Things were messy then. And type design was messy, too. Words were splayed and chaotic, letters blurred. Textures were thick and heavy. Concert posters looked like someone had splattered paint on paper and then scratched out band names. You may have noticed it, you may not have, but at its peak, this typography style, called grunge, was ubiquitous.</p>
<p>It was everywhere—and then it wasn&#8217;t.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps it&#8217;s time for designers to explore the style again with a modern twist.  The era of perfectly polished pixels, structures and form needs a challenger to shake things up.</p>
