<h2>How Branding and Transparency Help charity: water Stand Out</h2>
<p>Scott Harrison from charity: water stopped by the new 37signals office to speak to the team about the unconventional ways that charity: water stands out from other charities through branding and transparency.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another key to CW’s success is that 100% of donations are used for direct water project costs. (A group of private donors, foundations and sponsors help pay for the everyday costs of running the organization.) CW even pays for the paypal and credit card transaction fees when people donate online so each penny goes straight to actually building a well.</p>
