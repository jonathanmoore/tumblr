<h2>Tumblr Checkout Process</h2>
<p>One of the many things that keeps me active with Tumblr is the insane attention to detail and polish.  The easy approach to handling a credit card checkout process would be to use a standard page full of form fields, secure icons, and the default pictures of the credit cards they accept (along with virtually every other site online).</p>
<p>I was pleasantly surprised by Tumblr&#8217;s checkout method when grabbing <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tumblr.com/directory/feature">a featured directory spot</a> earlier this week.  After filling in the details the oversized &#8220;Make me famous!&#8221; button triggers a lightbox style overlay where you fill in your credit card information.</p>
<p>Well done Tumblr.</p>
