<h2>A Call to Arms for Creative Firms</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“The forces of the creative industry are aligned against the artist. These forces pressure him to give his work away for free as a means of proving his worthiness of the assignment. Clients demand it. Industry associations deride it but offer alternatives that are just as costly and commoditizing. Agencies resign themselves to it.”</p>

<p>As I&#8217;m refining the business development process for <a title="New Ezra - Digital Culture Agency" target="_blank" href="http://newezra.com">New Ezra</a> the insight from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.winwithoutpitching.com/">Win Without Pitching</a> has been tremendously helpful.  I observed a lot of the principles in action while working at <a target="_self" href="http://www.2advanced.com">2Advanced Studios</a>, and I&#8217;m looking forward to the upcoming book to help refine the approach.</p>
