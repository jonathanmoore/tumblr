<p><a href="http://rainypixels.com/" target="_blank">Nishant Kothary</a> recounts the fascinating of story of the new Microsoft.com site lead by Paravel and the brave team at Microsoft.  In an attempt to modernize <a href="http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/microsoft.com" target="_blank">the 30th most visited site on the internet</a>, the team found a way to overcome mountains of data that can easily drive safe design to &#8220;design from the gut".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Designing from the gut is a radical concept. It is generally met with a tremendous amount of friction in most software circles that tend to rely heavily on &#8220;logic and data" for all decisions. This is not to say that there isn&#8217;t a place for telemetry or usability studies in the act of designing software. It&#8217;s simply a question of when and where.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally <a href="http://paravelinc.com/work/microsoft.php" target="_blank">Paravel published a great case study</a> on their site showing off some of the finer details of the redesign.</p>
