<h2>COLOR. <span class="noBold"> MIX IT UP.</span></h2>
<p>Paper is alive with color. Bring your creations to life using our collection of brilliantly expressive Palettes and mix your own colors with a brand new tool the Mixer—a completely new way to explore color and the biggest leap in color controls in the past 40 years. Built on our powerful new core technology, the Mixer combines an intuitive mixing control and our custom color blending for color that looks and feels right. Need more reasons to create? Our Expressive Ink Engine™ is now pressure-sensitive with support for the Pogo Connect.</p>
<p>The new version of Paper is here. Welcome to a colorful new world of possibilities.</p>

<p>Paper already is one of my favorite iPad apps, but the new color blending options put it over the top!</p>
