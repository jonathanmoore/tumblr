<p>“Only with the passing of time can the intense emotions (positive or negative) of an event fall away and allow us to recognize mistakes.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think the most important thing about mistakes and failures isn&#8217;t just recognizing them, but embracing them as a crucial part of your journey to success—or simply less mistakes.</p>
<p>There is a lot of value in our mistakes as well.  Not just for our own development and growth, but to share with others.  I have some pretty big failures and mistakes—<em>telling <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk" target="_blank">Elon Musk</a> he had no idea what he was talking about during the SpaceX site design, overbidding a client proposal by $100,000, taking on well paying clients that I morally disagreed with</em>—that I need to write down share with others, so that they can hopefully learn some small lesson from them.</p>
