<h2><strong>Aelita Andre - Prodigy of Color</strong></h2>
<p>At a very early age <a href="http://www.aelitaandreart.com/" target="_blank">Aelita Andre</a>&#8217;s parents watched their daughter paint expressively and with passion.  To help encourage her artistic abilities they setup a studio that where she can brush, splash, paint and create her expressive and colorful art.  In this 13 minute short film you can see the four year old abstract painter at work in her studio.</p>
<p>Although I&#8217;m unsure if she truly is an art prodigy or that her parents are simply skilled marketers (<em>an entirely different debate</em>), it is amazing to see a young and uninhibited creative mind in action.  Right now her art is on exhibition in New York City&#8217;s <a href="http://www.aelitaandreart.com/aelitaandre/Exhibitions.html" target="_blank">Agora Gallery</a> in Chelsea through June 25th.  If you want to pick up one of her pieces it&#8217;ll only set you back $25,000.</p>
