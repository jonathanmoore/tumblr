<h2>Epic Photo</h2>
<p>Arnþór Ævarsson managed to capture both the Northern Lights and spewing lava in this incredible photo.  Talk about being at the right place at the right time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a prelude to the current massive volcanic eruption in Eyjafjallajökull causing extensive air traffic disruption in Europe, a moderate eruption took place just days before on the east side of the volcano. The location provided an opportunity for up-close encounters with picturesque craters and lava flows, in contrast to the inaccessibility of the following eruption site at the top of the volcano. With a team of Jeep enthusiasts and other photography nerds, I was able to travel to the remote site of the eruption. &#8230;</p>
