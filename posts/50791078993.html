<blockquote><p>We speak of three kinds of laziness. The first is simply to spend all your time eating and sleeping. The second is to tell yourself, &#8220;Someone like me will never manage to perfect themselves.&#8221; In the Buddhist context, such laziness makes you feel that it&#8217;s pointless even trying, you&#8217;ll never attain any spiritual realization. Discouragement makes you prefer not even to begin making any effort. And the third kind&#8230; is to waste your life on tasks of secondary importance, without ever getting down to what&#8217;s most essential. You spend all your time trying to resolve minor problems, one after another in an endless sequence, like ripples on the surface of a lake. You tell yourself that once you&#8217;ve finished this or that project you&#8217;ll start giving some meaning to your life.</p></blockquote>
