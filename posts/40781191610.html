<h2><strong>Zonebox</strong></h2>

<p>Over the years I have figured out that I work best in a series of focused sprints.  Some of my most productive days happen when I focus in on a single task for a set amount of time, take a break, and then move on to the next focused task.</p>

<p>This morning I came across <a href="http://rinik.net/zonebox/" target="_blank">Zonebox</a>, a new “timeboxing” app by <a href="http://blog.rinik.net/" target="_blank">Vojtech Rinik</a> that might work really well with my process.  With Zonebox you add a handful of tasks that you&#8217;re working on, give them time limits and then click “focus in”.  The app will give you a countdown and a subtle progress bar at the bottom of your screen so that you know how much longer you have to focus.</p>
