<blockquote><p>As digital marketers seek to increase profits, they almost always make the same mistake. They continue to add more clutter, messaging and offers, because, hey, it&#8217;s free. [&#8230;] Once you overload the user, you train them not to pay attention. More clutter isn&#8217;t free. In fact, more clutter is a permanent shift, a desensitization to all the information, not just the last bit.</p></blockquote>
