<blockquote>
  <p>“If you go to work and do what you&#8217;re told, you&#8217;re not being negative, certainly, but the lack of initiative you demonstrate (which, alas, you were trained not to demonstrate) costs us all, because you&#8217;re using a slot that could have been filled by someone who would have added more value. [&#8230;]</p>
  
  <p>Not adding value is the same as taking it away.”</p>
  
  <p>— Seth Godin</p>

<p>I could not agree more with <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2013/01/the-cost-of-neutral.html" target="_blank">this post by Seth Godin</a>.  Having people on your team operate at neutral is often more costly than having someone negative on the team.  At least with someone underperforming or negative it&#8217;s clear when you need to part ways, but the neutral team members tend to stay around longer than they should.</p>
