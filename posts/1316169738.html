<h2>Where do you go when you need to get work done?</h2>
<p>Jason Fried recently <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2613-when-you-really-need-to-get-work-done-where-do-you-go" target="_blank">asked this question on signal vs. noise</a> and <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2613-when-you-really-need-to-get-work-done-where-do-you-go?60#comments" target="_blank">the responses were quite interesting.</a></p>
<p>For me when I&#8217;m in a creative mode I need a lot of people around to help me really focus in.  I always feel far more productive when I’m in a busy public place, like a coffee shop, with a good pair of noise canceling headphones. Somehow the active act of ignoring all the busyness moving around me helps me to zone in and focus.</p>
