<p>User experience agency <a target="_blank" href="http://www.teehanlax.com/">Teehan+Lax</a> published a post that explains why they&#8217;re moving from time-based to value-based billing for their agency.  For years I have been charging value-based, and it&#8217;s incredibly rare that I personally or my <a title="New Ezra - Digital Culture Agency" target="_blank" href="http://newezra.com">agency New Ezra</a> bills by the hour.  I really like the way they explained their reasoning for the switch to value-based.</p>
