<h2><strong>What if Money Was No Object - Alan Watts</strong></h2>

<p>&gt; “And after all, if you do really like what you’re doing, it doesn’t matter what it is, you can eventually turn it – you could eventually become a master of it. It’s the only way to become a master of something, to be really with it. And then you’ll be able to get a good fee for whatever it is. So don’t worry too much.”</p>
