<p>I&#8217;m excited to be in our new space for <a href="http://stylehatch.co" target="_blank">Style Hatch</a>.  We have a lot of work ahead of us with our new <a href="http://myturnstone.com" target="_blank">Turnstone desks</a> being delivered today, a kitchen to install, and a mountain of wood for our design and build out.</p>
<p>We have some fresh new themes for Tumblr in the works—unlike anything else we&#8217;ve launched.  Beyond themes we are evolving Style Hatch to give people the tools, resources and designs to express their creativity and genius online.</p>
<p>It feels good to have a fresh start, full of vision and excitement for what&#8217;s ahead.</p>
