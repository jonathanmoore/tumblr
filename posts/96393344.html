<h2>Get Rich Slow</h2>
<p>“At no other time in recent history has it been easier or cheaper to start a new kind of company. Possibly a very profitable company. Let’s call these start-ups LILOs, for ‘a little in, a lot out.’ These are Web-based businesses that cost almost nothing to get off the ground yet can turn into great moneymakers (if you work hard and are patient).”</p>
<p>&#8220;Launching now will make your company stronger later — you&#8217;ll learn to survive on fumes until the economy improves.&#8221;</p>
<p>We&#8217;re living an amazing time full of opportunity that will reward those who take on the risk venture out during this time of economic turmoil.</p>
