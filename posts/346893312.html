<h2>&#8220;22620&#8221; Landscape Series by Nando Costa</h2>
<p>Brazillian graphic artist, illustrator and animator <a target="_blank" href="http://archive.nandocosta.com/">Nando Costa</a> (<i>now relocated to the booming Portland design scene</i>) created <a target="_blank" href="http://archive.nandocosta.com/#230700/-22620-Landscape-Series">&#8220;22620&#8221; Landscape Series, 10-piece series of wood engraved artwork</a> inspired by his neighborhood in Rio de Janeiro.  All of the illustrations were created digitally and then laser etched into the treated maple wood.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The title of this piece refers to the zip code of my neighborhood in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Each of the forthcoming artworks will be inspired by a different location which I have been to and have influenced me in some shape or form. This particular one depicts in an iconic way the beaches and mountains near my home, while also graphically representing some personal aspirations and goals.</p>
