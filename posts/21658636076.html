<h2>In the theme &quot;Origin West&quot; you just released, how on earth did you extract a user&#039;s most recent Instagram shots and display them? I&#039;ve been trying to figure it out but I just can&#039;t! (It looks beautiful, by the way.)</h2>
<p><a href="http://originwest.stylehatch.co" target="_blank">Origin West</a> is our first theme to include the user&#8217;s Instagram feed.  In order to access the user&#8217;s feed they will first have to authorize your application (<em>in this case, a theme</em>).  Check out the <a href="http://instagr.am/developer/auth/" target="_blank">Instagram developer site for their oAuth details</a>.</p>
<p>I have seen a few themes put together a Tumblr static page to send the authorization request as well as return the access token, but we simply put together a quick page at <a href="http://stylehatch.co/instagram/" target="_blank">stylehatch.co/instagram</a>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re working on setting up the Style Hatch Github account where we are planning our process as well as a few other jQuery plugins that we use, like our <a href="http://originwest.stylehatch.co/post/21427665866/jon-duenas-photography" target="_blank">resizable custom photoset grid</a>.</p>
