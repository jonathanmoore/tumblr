<h2><strong>Managing Criticism in Design Exploration</strong></h2>
<p>Nearly all successful teams understand and value a design exploration approach to solving problems, but how do you productively critic designs when so many options are being explored regardless of job titles or seniority?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Design decisions should always be based on what’s appropriate for the task at hand. If you find your design is being beaten down, the best way to fight back is to counter with “Well, when would my design be appropriate?”. Conversely, before you take pleasure in destroying someone else’s hard work, first make sure that you can answer “When is this solution great?”. [&#8230;]</p>
<p>Lastly, always remember the golden rule of critique: don’t be a dick.</p>
