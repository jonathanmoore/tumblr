<blockquote><p>At a time when websites are spilling off desktops onto sidewalks and computing in public spaces is dissolving into behavior, technology itself has shown boundary blindness. And humans are following suit. We carry our televisions in our pockets. We pay with our phones. And we read more than ever before on an unpredictable number of screens. It is possible to see beyond the small fences of the familiar, but first you must see no boundaries.</p></blockquote>
