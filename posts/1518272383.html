<h2>When Ideas Have Sex</h2>
<p>Frog Design looks the way that ideas travel, reproduce and evolve in human history in their first essay for Fast Company.  They make the case that the ability for humans to exchange ideas is key human invention.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In every case it was openness to exchange, within and among nations, that drove innovation (and predation by chiefs, priests, and thieves that shut it down). The same is true today. Countries that open their borders to the free exchange of goods and services and ideas and innovations flourish, while those that cut themselves off and seek economic self-sufficiency stagnate. </p>
