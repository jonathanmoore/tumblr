<h2>Color 2.0</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Color is a live broadcast from your phone. Unlike videos, there&#8217;s no audio, editing, or uploading. You got 30 seconds to tell your story. Up to 5,000 friends can simultaneously visit your broadcast from their phone and Facebook.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So after rehashing the complete flop of the first version of <a href="http://www.color.com/" target="_blank">Color</a>, they&#8217;re putting their $41,000,000 in funding to use to launch a platform to broadcast 30 seconds of boring, soundless video to Facebook.  Isn&#8217;t audio half the magic of video?</p>
