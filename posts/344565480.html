<h2>Behance Action Journal</h2>
<p>Over the years I have used all type of books, journals, and pads to take notes, stay organized, and plan.  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.behance.com/">Behance</a> has created by far my favorite system for capturing actions, but before now my only complaint was the flimsy cover that took a beating rather quickly.  They just updated several of their products to give the journal a thick hard cover that looks comparable to a moleskin notebook.  The new journal comes in the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.creativesoutfitter.com/Products/Action-Journal/19">action</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.creativesoutfitter.com/Products/Dot-Grid-Journal/20">dot-grid</a> formats.  I just ordered both.</p>
