<h2>Abandoned Six Flags New Orleans</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>This is probably the riskiest location we&#8217;ve been. Before we decided to take our chances and journey out to this iconic location, we took notice of all the stories we had heard of others trying their luck at getting in. There were rumors of a guard tentatively watching the perimeter and grounds. Other stories said that people were caught by workers or police. And it seemed to be a consistent critique. So we took a gamble and decided to go. Only, to our surprise, it was relatively easy to get in, completely vacant of any guards or watchmen, and we were pleasantly greeted by two other groups of young guys who were just exploring the park for fun. We stayed for a couple of hours and had a blast. It was an unusual feeling being in an entire rotting amusement park (almost) completely alone.</p>
