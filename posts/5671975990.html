<h2><strong>Swell 1.0 Launch &amp; Style Hatch Update</strong></h2>
<p>Finally, the latest <a href="http://stylehatch.co" target="_blank">Style Hatch</a> <a href="http://swell-theme.tumblr.com" target="_blank">premium theme, Swell</a> is live!  Although the design is a bit more on the simplistic side there is an insane amount of detail that went into the build and overall experience.  Early next week I&#8217;ll write up a post going into the details of how I pull off some of the more intense features.  For now, here&#8217;s an overview of some of my favorite features:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Infinite scrolling &amp; lightbox post view</strong> - One of the things I don&#8217;t like about most infinite scrolling sites is scrolling down several pages, clicking on a post, and going back to find that I lost where I&#8217;m at.  To get around this in Swell I introduced a lightbox style post viewer.  With the viewer the page never has to refresh or update as you&#8217;re browsing.</li>
<li><strong>Deep linking and browser history</strong> - As you&#8217;re going through the posts you will notice that the URL updates with post hashbangs (<a href="http://swell-theme.tumblr.com/#!/post/5649171891/water-changes-everything" target="_blank">/#!/post/5649171891/water-changes-everything</a>) that allow you to copy and paste the URLs.  Plus this allows for the browser to track your history so that you can use the back / forward buttons.</li>
<li><strong>Keyboard shortcuts</strong> - Browse the posts by hitting J/K to go next/back and ESC to close the window.</li>
<li><strong>Description reveal</strong> - Rather than cluttering the page with the site description, recent tweets, liked posts, Flickr posts, etc all of those features are hidden at the top of the site in a reveal.  You can click the top right triangle, about link in the header, or browse to (<a href="http://swell-theme.tumblr.com/#!/about" target="_blank">/#!/about</a>) to see the reveal.</li>
<li><strong>Typekit</strong> - Like all the other Style Hatch themes this one includes full Typekit support allowing you to set the title, body and UI fonts.</li>
</ul><h3><strong>Swell Updates</strong></h3>
<p>After seeing <a href="http://cinthieyeater.com/" target="_blank">real-world usage</a> of Swell I already have a growing list of tweaks and improvements for the theme.  Most of them are focused on increasing performance so that the theme is lightning fast when hundreds of posts are on the page at once.  Across all the Style Hatch themes I&#8217;ve pushed live nearly 100 updates, so this is only the beginning.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, ideas or issue email me personally at <a href="mailto:swell@stylehatch.co" target="_blank">swell@stylehatch.co</a>.  I always try to get to emails within a day with the exception of weekends and holidays.</p>
<h3><strong>Giving Back</strong></h3>

<p>At the beginning of May I decided to start taking a portion of each theme&#8217;s sales to give back and help do good in developing countries.  Now, for every 5 themes sold 1 person will be given access to clean water through <a href="http://www.charitywater.org/" target="_blank">Charity Water</a>.  At the close of the month I will share more details, including the ability to track and see specific freshwater projects that were made possible through Style Hatch.  I really hope that this doesn&#8217;t come across as a marketing gimmick.  Honestly I&#8217;m extremely excited to give back to something that makes a real difference.  <strong>Already hundreds of people will be helped.</strong>  <a href="http://www.charitywater.org/whywater/" target="_blank">Learn more about what Charity Water is doing—Why Water</a>?</p>
<h3><strong>The Future of Style Hatch</strong></h3>
<p>There is a lot going on behind the scenes with <a href="http://stylehatch.co" target="_blank">Style Hatch</a> right now as I&#8217;m working to launch even more <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/themes/by/jonathanmoore" target="_blank">premium Tumblr themes</a> and move to other platforms (<em>no plans for Wordpress themes</em>).  On Monday <a href="http://blog.jessbrown.me/" target="_blank">Jess Brown</a>, my first full-time employee, starts working with me at New Ezra and Style Hatch.  His official role will be the director of customer experience which will cover support, outreach, as well as many other things.  <strong>The future is extremely bright!</strong></p>
