<blockquote>
  <p>You know what is fun? Making things. Turning a spark of creative insight into a thing that you can show people — a thing that people can use and from which they can derive some iota of pleasure or utility. Start with a simple website. Basic HTML and CSS. No product is too small. In fact, the opposite is true. If you don’t know how to build the first version of your product in a weekend — a usable working version, don’t try to build it. Programming is a means to an end, not an end in itself. You should be trying to do as little of it as possible to make the thing that you want.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fastest way to make something is to simply start.  Don&#8217;t get caught in the never ending process of learning, researching, and over-thinking your idea.</p>
