<h2>The Last Advertising Agency On Earth</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>This office is being preserved just as it was found after everyone vanished.  We can even see what they were doing when that moment came, filling in time sheets, getting another coffee, playing foosball.  They were carrying on as they always had.  Ignorant to the great change going on all around them that would soon destroy them all.</p>
