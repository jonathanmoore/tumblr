<h2>Art Suggestions</h2>
<p>After three weeks in the new <a href="http://newezra.com" target="_blank">New Ezra</a> and <a href="http://stylehatch.co" target="_blank">Style Hatch</a> office space it is finally starting to take shape.  Now there is plenty of room to expand the team with two or three talented people in the coming months.</p>
<p>As you can see all the walls are bare and empty.  I would love to fill the walls with art, prints and interesting books.  As I start to look for the right pieces this week, any suggestions you have would be amazing.  What do you think should go on the walls?</p>
