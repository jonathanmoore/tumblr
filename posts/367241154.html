<h2>Quirky - Socially Developed Products</h2>
<p>Created as a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.quirky.com/learn">social product development company</a>, people submit their product ideas to the community where the product is influenced, designed, created and then sold.  After your idea makes it past the community and design team jury, everyone has the opportunity to help shape and design the product through the development process.</p>
<p>Take a look at the products that have been created so far in the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.quirky.com/products">Quirky store</a>.</p>
