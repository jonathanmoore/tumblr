<h2><a href="http://pieratt.tumblr.com/post/7537191978">The internet kills all middlemen.</a></h2>
<p><a href="http://pieratt.tumblr.com/post/7537191978" target="_blank">Ben Pieratt</a>, designer and founder of <a href="http://svpply.com/" target="_blank">Svpply</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The market is handing you steak and you’re choosing the gristle. The market is handing you gold bullion and you’re taking the nickel.</p>
<p>As a designer, you enjoy building things for other people’s use. Your value is determined by the degree to which you can empathize with groups of people around a given topic. Historically, this relationship has required a large(r) company to act as mediator for the emotional mass-transaction. Companies provide you with an audience inasmuch as they have customers, and that’s enough for you because you just want to design stuff that solves stuff.</p>
<p>The internet kills all middlemen.</p>
<p>You now have direct access to the raw vein of popular attention. The pixels you’re pushing have a higher exchange rate than you’re giving yourself credit for*. No hounding client payroll, no selling other people’s stuff, no building other people’s wealth, no nephew’s cousins stepping in with the authority to change everything you’ve been working on.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>There has never been a greater opportunity for designers, makers and doers.  Well said!</p>
