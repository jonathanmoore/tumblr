<h2>Skateboarding Mythology</h2>
<p>A series of illustrations created by <a href="http://trevorburks.com/" target="_blank">Trevor Burks</a> based on his personal mythologies surrounding growing up skateboarding in a small town.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The urban environment is built using mostly logic and has its own practical purpose. But human nature is not totally logical, and humans are not completely practical. Skateboarding is expressive. It is in essence a reinterpretation of the environment. Sidewalks, streets, curbs, ledges, rails, walls, banks, ditches, all have their own practical purpose, but their form is such that it can be used as an expressive tool. Skateboarding allows us to emotionally engage with our man-made environment. In the same way that surfers compete with nature, skateboarders compete with the design of our modern environment. It is a critique of human accomplishments by the human spirit.</p>
