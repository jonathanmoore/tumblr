<h2><strong>David Ogilvy: We Sell or Else</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>You know the trouble with many agencies [designer, startups, entrepreneurs, studios] is that they don&#8217;t really think in terms of selling.  They&#8217;ve never written direct response.  They&#8217;ve never tasted blood.</p>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, I envy you. For forty years, I’ve been a voice crying in the wilderness. Today, my first love is coming to its own. You face a golden future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Forty years ago the advertising and marketing visionary, David Ogilvy, talked about the new &#8220;secret weapon&#8221; of direct response with it&#8217;s specific and measurable results.  If he were alive today during the internet age, I&#8217;m certain his message would remain the same.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t let creativity take over your ability to sell on the behalf of a client, account, product or business.</strong></p>
