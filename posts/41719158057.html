<p><strong>An upgrade, years in the making…</strong></p>
<p>When we imagined Tumblr more than seven years ago, we dreamed of offering creators a new canvas. Every post would be a raw look through the author’s eyes and mind. We imagined the interface disappearing as these subjects came to life.</p>
<p>For years, this vision was challenged by limits in browser technology and an increasingly daunting set of Tumblr features to support. But today, we take a huge step.</p>
<p>After months of careful crafting, we’ve reduced <em>creation</em> on Tumblr to its essence, while carrying over <em>every single feature</em> and making room for some BIG new ones (like completely customizable drag-and-drop photoset creation, faster uploads, and inline reblogging!). We can’t wait for you to try it.</p>
<p>The upgrades have started rolling out and will be available for everyone by the end of the weekend. <strong>Most of the bugs and omissions you’ve reported have already been fixed, but please <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/help?form=true" target="_blank">let us know</a> if you run in to any other issues!</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tumblr&#8217;s design, product and engineering team did a fantastic job with this major update to the dashboard.  Finally being able to drag files into Photo posts and rearrange photoset grids is a beautiful thing.</p>
