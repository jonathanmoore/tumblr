<h2>Hi Jonathan. I just purchased your beautiful &quot;Inspire Well Theme&quot;. The only thing I am confused on how to omit would be the search box. Since I am using your theme for my portfolio I don&#039;t need a search box. Any suggestions? Thank you!</h2>
<p>Thanks for picking up <a href="http://inspirewell.stylehatch.co" target="_blank">Inspire Well</a>!  When I designed and created the theme over two years ago I certainly had it in mind as an option for a portfolio or highly visual blog.</p>
<p>You can add a bit of CSS to the theme to hide the search box.  Go into the Customize menu and under the Advanced drop down paste in the following:</p>
<p><code>.</code><span>search_wrap { display: none; }</span></p>
<p>If you have more questions about Inspire Well send us an email at <a href="mailto:inspirewell@stylehatch.co" target="_blank">inspirewell@stylehatch.co</a>.  During the weekdays we get back to everyone in at least 12 hours, although usually an hour or so, but over the weekend we take a break to spend time with our families.</p>
<p>Also, let us know if you have any suggestions for Inspire Well.  We regularly add new features and improvements to the theme.</p>
