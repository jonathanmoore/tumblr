<h2>BBQ War</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://bbqwar.com/" target="_blank">BBQWar</a> began as an idea by <a href="http://ismaelburciaga.com/" target="_blank">Ismael Burciaga</a> while he was barbecuing one day and posting images via Twitter. A couple of Ismael’s friends also began tweeting tantalizing pictures of what they were grilling. Soon it became obvious that a grilling “war” had been unofficially declared, so Ismael began placing #BBQWar on his tweets to his friends with an image attached. Several weeks later, the site ‘BBQWar’ was birthed.</p>
