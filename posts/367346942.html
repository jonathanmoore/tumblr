<h2>Virtual Story Layers</h2>
<p>Jawbone.tv recently featured an article on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jawbone.tv/featured/2-featured/381-augmented-books-camille-scherrer-revives-print-with-virtual-story-layers.html">augmented books</a> and adding additional story layers and elements.  I would love to work with a children&#8217;s book publisher to develop a virtual layer like this.</p>

<p>Much energy has been spent recently trying to discover ways for technology to simultaneously spread story across multiple media. And while this is a worthwhile pursuit, some independent creators have chosen instead to narrow their efforts, focusing on applying technology to the untapped corners of a single medium. Case in point is media and interaction designer Camille Scherrer and her exploration of the interactive realms of the printed page.</p>
