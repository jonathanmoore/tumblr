<h2><a href="http://www.ignitiongroup.com/propulsion/entry/why-architects-dont-install-sheetrock/">Why Architects Don't Install Sheetrock</a></h2>
<p>As an agency, studio or freelancer are you an architect, general contractor or subcontractor?  Agency consulting firm <a href="http://www.ignitiongroup.com/" target="_blank">Ignition Group</a> explains why it is time to re-evaluate where your company&#8217;s true strengths and value to clients are and learn to when to outsource more of the “commoditized” services.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using a building analogy, professional firms must be the architects.  They can even be the general contractors.  But when they also try to be the subcontractors, they lose their shirt.  Think Frank Lloyd Wright installing the sheet rock.  The value of FLW was his ideas, his imagination, and his vision for the building.  Although there’s certainly a difference between a good job and a poor job of hanging sheetrock, the truth is that millions of people can do it.  There are not millions of Frank Lloyd Wrights.</p>
