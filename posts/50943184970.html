<blockquote>
<p><span>David always obsessed over his newest ideas, features, and designs until they were completely polished and ready to go. He’s a workaholic — he truly lives and breathes Tumblr. I’ve never even seen him show any desire to work on a side project. David is all Tumblr, all the time. [&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span>We — internet users, creative people, publishers, socializers — will be much better served if David can focus on his product’s features, design, and messaging instead of worrying about server architecture and raising more money.</span></p>
<p><span>This is why I’m optimistic about the Yahoo acquisition.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>Marco Arment skillfully articulates the early days of Tumblr and David Karp&#8217;s unrelenting focus on Tumblr.  Tumblr has very bright days ahead.</span></p>
