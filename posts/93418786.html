<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>For quite some time I have planned on creating a blog to share my thoughts on the interactive industry, creativity, and technology.  Rather than continuing to put off launching a blog I have decided to go with the tumblr platform because of it&#8217;s ease of use and more informal nature.  Eventually I plan on customizing this blog and truly making it my home, but for now the most important thing is simply getting started.</p>
<p>I imagine this site will evolve over time, but the core objective of the site is three-fold:</p>
<ol><li>Share ideas liberally</li>
<li>Provide a broad source of inspiration</li>
<li>Fuel creative innovation</li>
</ol><p>Please feel free to send me comments, questions, ideas to <a title="jmoore@newezra.com" href="mailto:jmoore@newezra.com" target="_blank">jmoore@newezra.com</a></p>
