<h2>Making Ideas Happen</h2>
<p><strong>&#8220;Ideas are worthless if you can&#8217;t make them happen.&#8221;</strong>  The process of turning your ideas in reality takes organization, execution, communal forces, and leadership.  For several years I have been a part of the <a target="_blank" href="http://behance.net">Behance community</a> and followed the evolution of Behance lead by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.scottbelsky.com/">Scott Belsky</a> from a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.creativesoutfitter.com/">product line</a>, to a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.behance.com/Products/Advisory_Services">consultancy</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.behance.net/">creative network</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.actionmethod.com/">productivity web application</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://the99percent.com/">thought leader</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://the99percent.com/conference">conference</a>, and now a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Making-Ideas-Happen-Overcoming-Obstacles/dp/159184312X/newezra-20">book</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had this book on pre-order since February and next week on April 15th the book will finally ship.  I&#8217;m anticipating this book to be one of the more valuable books I read this year; based on Behance&#8217;s other content and the reviews I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;ll live up to my anticipation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many of us believe that great ideas inevitably lead to success. Nothing could be further from the truth. Whether it is the perfect solution for an everyday problem or a bold new concept for a creative masterpiece, you must transform vision into reality for an idea to have value.</p>
<p>This book chronicles the methods of exceptionally productive creative leaders and teams – companies like Google, IDEO, and Disney, and individuals like author Chris Anderson and Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh – that make their ideas happen, time and time again.</p>
