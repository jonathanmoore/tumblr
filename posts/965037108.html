<h2>Fifty of Fifty</h2>
<p>Photographer and designer <a href="http://ricknunn.com/" target="_blank">Rick Nunn</a> is getting close to completing his <strong>Project 50</strong>—<em>50 days, 50 photos with a 50mm lens</em>.  Best of all he is posting videos of the setup involved in most of the shots.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I get asked a lot — “Why are you doing this?”, generally my answer is — “Just for the sake of it”. But let me expand on that a little more. To me the value of this project is completely inherent in the act of doing it or, more importantly, the act of completing it at a level of quality with which I am happy — I&#8217;m doing it to prove to myself that I can.</p>
