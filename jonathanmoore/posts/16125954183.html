<blockquote><p>We found the startups that did best were the ones with the sort of founders about whom we&#8217;d say &#8220;they can take care of themselves." The startups that do best are fire-and-forget in the sense that all you have to do is give them a lead, and they&#8217;ll close it, whatever type of lead it is.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>— Paul Graham on the <a href="http://paulgraham.com/word.html" target="_blank">correlation between resourcefulness and success in startups</a>.</strong></p>
<p>I am incredibly thankful for my years at <a href="http://2advanced.com" target="_blank">2Advanced</a> back in the fast-paced, mid-2000s Flash era.  Everyone who worked on that team during that period of time learned the value of resourcefulness as you were expected to often single handedly art direct, animate, and develop large campaigns all while managing the clients.  The level of expectation, stress and demand was high, but whether or not it was the best approach to it developed a character of resourcefulness by fire.</p>
