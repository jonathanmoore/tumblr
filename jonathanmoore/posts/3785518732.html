<blockquote><p>People think that design is styling. Design is not style. It&#8217;s not about giving shape to the shell and not giving a damn about the guts. Good design is a renaissance attitude that combines technology, cognitive science, human need, and beauty to produce something that the world didn&#8217;t know it was missing.</p></blockquote>
