<h2><a href="http://the99percent.com/articles/6732/welcome-to-the-era-of-creative-meritocracy">Welcome to the Era of Creative Meritocracy</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Imagine a world where the best ideas have the best chance to succeed. No more favoritism that places the wrong people on creative projects. Cut out the middlemen that arbitrarily recommend cost-efficient talent over the most deserving talent. Forget the corporate nepotism that appoints leaders based on relationships over merit. Every individual, team, and industry would benefit from a world where the most talented people got the most opportunity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the last year and a half I have been living in this era of creative meritocracy.  After walking away from the often counter-meritocracy advertising agency world I could not be more thrilled with the opportunities that have opened up.  If you&#8217;re not doing what you love today, then why don&#8217;t you start?</p>
