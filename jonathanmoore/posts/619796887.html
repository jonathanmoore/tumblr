<h2>$1,000+ a Day Without Making the Top 1000 Downloads</h2>
<p>Currently there&#8217;s a race to the top (or bottom depending on how you view it) to churn out a large quantity of iPhone/iPad apps at cheap prices to break into the top downloads.  Rather than focusing on how to break into the top downloads iTeleport worked to maintain their quality and kept their app at a premium price of $25.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How did we get here?  We believe it&#8217;s a combination of creating a high quality product with great support in a well-defined market with significant demand.  This doesn&#8217;t sound too different from classic definitions of how to develop a successful software business, and it&#8217;s not.  &#8230; That, combined with offering something people really want, and are willing to pay a premium for if you give them distinctive, useful, hard-to-find features in return.</p>
