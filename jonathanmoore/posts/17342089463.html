<blockquote><p>Don&#8217;t ignore your fear. Acknowledge it. As soon as you know you&#8217;re going to give that speech or design that training program, take a quiet moment and experience the fear that comes with the importance of the project. … Resist the temptation to minimize your anxiety. That&#8217;s a false macho response and it lacks courage. It&#8217;s also counterproductive; it gives power to the fear, almost guaranteeing that it will haunt you and prevent your progress.</p></blockquote>
