<h2>Golden Fields</h2>
<p>Looking for an excuse to try out my new Pocket Wizards and light modifiers we took a trip down into the O&#8217;neill regional park to take portraits of my kids. The original plan was to have them sitting together, but after my boy took a few dives face first into the grass we decided he needed hand standing up.</p>
