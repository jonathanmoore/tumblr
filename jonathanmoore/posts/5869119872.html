<h2><strong>Lost Type Co-op</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://losttype.com/" target="_blank">Lost Type Co-op</a> is a collaboration between Tyler Galpin and Riley Cran. It was founded with the intention of providing unique and quality fonts based on a pay-what-you-want model. All designers get 100% of the donations their font receives. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Over the past few months I&#8217;ve been able to have a few good conversations with the up-and-coming designer <a href="http://galp.in/" target="_blank">Tyler Galpin</a>, and his story is quite inspiring.  Almost a year ago Tyler was working in at a bank in Canada wrangling spreadsheets and pursuing a career in finance.  At the same time he was trying to balance out his career with a passion for design.  One day while working on an insanely large spreadsheet it hit him that he should change course and dive head-first into what he loves—design.  </p>
<p>Through serious networking, hard work, raw talent and becoming <a href="http://dribbble.com/tylergalpin" target="_blank">incredibly active in the design community</a> his career in design took off.  Keep an eye on Tyler.</p>
<p>To sum it up, <strong>don&#8217;t waste time doing anything other than what you love</strong>.</p>
