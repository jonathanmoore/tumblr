<h2>We All Want to Be Young</h2>
<p>Looking at the current Millennial generation and how they compare to the Baby Boomer and Generation X generations Brazilian research company BOX1824 created the short film &#8220;We All Want to Be Young" as a part of their 5 year study into behavioral sciences and consumer trends.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today being normal has become boring, and in spite of neutralizing differences it is cool to express them.  It is possible to be a surfer, dj, rocker, nerd, cinephile, designer at the same time.  We&#8217;re talking about the most plural youth generation in history.  It is a plurality which guarantees that the young can simultaneously recognize themselves even with their personal differences. </p>
