<h2>Style Hatch Refresh</h2>
<p>Just a few hours ago we debuted our fresh, new branding for <a href="http://stylehatch.co" target="_blank">Style Hatch</a> along with a taste of our full site launching in April.  After over a decade of creating sites, campaigns and brand strategies for large brands from Activision to Microsoft, we have shifted out entire studio to create fresh designs for individuals with the goal of helping you show off your inner genius.</p>
<p><strong>We can&#8217;t wait to show off everything we have lined up!</strong>  Now for a few fun facts, since our first theme <a href="http://backburner.stylehatch.co" target="_blank">Backburner</a> we have launched<strong> 15 themes</strong>, pushed live <strong>109 updates</strong> to the themes, and answered <strong>27,697 support emails</strong> as of yesterday morning.</p>
<p><em>A part of the refresh we even had fancy new letterpress cards created just in time for SXSW.  Check out a <a href="http://dribbble.com/shots/460944-Style-Hatch-Cards" target="_blank">shot of the cards on Dribbble</a>.</em></p>
