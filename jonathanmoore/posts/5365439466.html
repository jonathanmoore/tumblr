<h2><a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2904-forget-passion-focus-on-process">Forget Passion, Focus on Process</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Find meaning in what you’re doing. Work to improve your industry. Get joy from making a customer’s day. Surround yourself with the kinds of people and environment that keep you engaged. Figure out the details and day-to-day process that keep you stimulated. Focus on how you execute and making continual improvements. Get off on how you sell, not what you sell.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Process is what motivates me and moves me forward.  Product launches are fun and full of energy, but it the tweaking and refining of the process and customer experience where you will see the most gains.  </p>
<p><strong>Like quality over quantity, put process over passion.</strong></p>
