<h2><a href="http://thinkvitamin.com/business/marketing/how-we-increased-conversions-by-24-with-video/">How Think Vitamin increased membership conversions by 24% with video</a></h2>
<p>Excellent case study from Think Vitamin on the benefits video for online conversion and the importance of metrics and testing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The takeaway here is that potential customers want a quick summary of the product, not an actual demo. The bigger takeaway here though is this: you <em>have</em> to be testing your site to see what works and what doesn’t. Going on a gut feeling won’t work. In fact, this very method that worked better for us may not work for you. You won’t know until you test.</p>
