<h2><strong>A Strange Flight</strong></h2>
<p>Designer, writer, and developer <a href="http://craigmod.com/" target="_blank">Craig Mod</a> considers the future of storytelling and storytelling during San Francisco&#8217;s monthly <a href="http://www.creativemornings.com" target="_blank">Creative Mornings</a>.  In the presentation he describes his experience of the Sendai earthquake that hit mid-flight on his way to Japan and the scene at the airport.  During the hours that followed he recounts how Twitter and other uncommon publishing tools were used to tell the story of the earthquake.</p>
<p>One of the take aways from the presentation in my own words&#8230;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Great design [art, life, work] is born from nourishing habits of constantly working toward empathy, no dismissal of ideas and the ability to shift from macro to micro perspectives.</p>
