<blockquote><p>Do what you think is right and apologize later.</p></blockquote>
<p>Excellent quote from Scott Wilson&#8217;s, founder of <a href="http://www.mnml.com/" target="_blank">MINIMAL</a> and creator of the <a href="http://mnml1.posterous.com/redrun-lunatik-is-here" target="_blank">LunaTik</a>, boss Ed Boyd while working at Nike.  Go to The 99 Percent and read the full article—<em><a href="http://the99percent.com/articles/7011/Scott-Wilson-Do-What-You-Think-Is-Right-Apologize-Later" target="_blank">Scott Wilson: Do What You Think Is Right &amp; Apologize Later</a></em> on design, entrepreneurship and taking risks—in fact I think I should read it again.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My boss at Nike, Ed Boyd, told me: “Do what you think is right and apologize later.” That really gave me free rein. And I fell in love with that culture and way of doing things. It’s very entrepreneurially focused. There’s a lot of people at Nike, they go under the radar, and they incubate something, and then they spring it on you.  </p>
<p>Nike really opened my eyes about how you actually talk to a consumer, and how you craft a story.</p>
