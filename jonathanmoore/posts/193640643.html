<h2>The Birth of a Shoe Company</h2>
<p>&#8220;Nineteen years ago, I wanted to open a shoe company with limited money. From experience I knew one had to get in quickly because so often new companies run out of cash flow before they get the chance to conduct business. I also knew it was easier to get credit from factories in Europe who needed the business than from American banks that didn&#8217;t. So I lined up the factories, went to Europe, designed a collection of shoes, and returned to the states to sell them.</p>
<p>At the time, a shoe company had two options. You could get a room at the Hilton and become 1 of about 1100 shoe companies selling their goods. This didn&#8217;t provide the identity or image I felt necessary for a new company, and it cost a lot more money than I had to spend. The other way was to do what the big companies do and get a fancy showroom in Midtown Manhattan not far from the Hilton. More identity, much more money too.</p>
<p>I had an idea.</p>
<p>I called a friend in the trucking business and asked to borrow one of his trucks to park in Midtown Manhattan. He said sure, but good luck getting permission. I went to the Mayor&#8217;s office, Koch at the time, and asked how one gets permission to park a 40 foot trailer truck in Midtown Manhattan. He said one doesn&#8217;t. The only people the city gives parking permits to are production companies shooting full length motion pictures and utility companies like Con Ed or AT&amp;T. So that day I went to the stationery store and changed our company letterhead from Kenneth Cole, Inc. to Kenneth Cole Productions, Inc. and the next day I applied for a permit to shoot a full length film entitled &#8220;The Birth of a Shoe Company.&#8221;</p>
<p>With Kenneth Cole Productions painted on the side of the truck, we parked at 1370&#160;6th Avenue, across from the New York Hilton, the day of shoe show. We opened for business with a fully furnished 40 ft trailer, a director (Sometimes there was film in the camera, sometimes there wasn&#8217;t), models as actresses, and two of New York&#8217;s finest, compliments of Mayor Koch, as our doormen. We sold 40 thousand pairs of shoes in two and a half days (the entire available production) and we were off and running.</p>
<p>To this day the company is still named Kenneth Cole Productions, Inc. and serves as a reminder to the importance of resourcefulness and innovative problem solving.&#8221;</p>
<p>The innovative beginnings of Kenneth Cole Productions, Inc. was driven by the determination to become resourceful when confronted with NO.<br/><a style="color: #007bff; " target="_blank" href="http://www.kennethcole.com/content/index.jsp?page=our_story&amp;h=1150&amp;w=898">Kenneth Cole - Our Story</a></p>
