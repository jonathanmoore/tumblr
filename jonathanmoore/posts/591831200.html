<h2><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2010/05/05/smallbusiness/1099_health_care_tax_change/index.htm">New 2012 Tax Change Nightmare</a></h2>
<h2>1099&#8217;d to Death</h2>
<p>Already every freelancer, small business, <em>and really everyone else</em> dreads taxes, but a change slipped into the Health Care Reform bill is going to be an absolute nightmare to deal with starting January 1, 2012.  </p>
<p>The new change requires freelancers, contractors, or companies to issue 1099s for services <strong>and goods</strong> over $600 to both individuals <strong>and companies</strong>.  What does this mean?  If you buy an iMac you&#8217;ll have to send Apple a 1099.  If you buy software upgrades from Adobe you&#8217;ll have to send them a 1099.  If you buy dozens of things from Amazon you&#8217;ll have to send them a 1099.</p>
<p>If the law was in effect last year I would have had to send out hundreds of 1099s to Apple, Best Buy, Dell, B&amp;H Photo, Amazon, Virgin America, Alaskan Airlines, American Airlines, Mariott, HIlton, BlueShield, and the list goes on.</p>
<p>Whoever comes up with a web app/service to deal with sending out all these 1099s will be sitting on a gold mine.</p>
