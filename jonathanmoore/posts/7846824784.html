<blockquote><p>We&#8217;re not meant to operate like computers. Human beings are designed to pulse between spending/renewing energy.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Tony Schwartz</strong></p>
<p>After a great vacation I&#8217;m fully refreshed and now ready to charge at full speed.  Don&#8217;t neglect the renewing energy phase.  As difficult as it is, the best thing you can do for your productivity, drive and creativity it to completely unplug.</p>
<p><em>The quote from Tony Schwartz was from a <a href="http://the99percent.com/articles/7056/25-Quotables-from-the-99-Conference" target="_blank">previous year&#8217;s 99% Conference</a>.  Don&#8217;t miss out on the 2012&#160;99% Conference since it will sell out fast!  I bought my tickets yesterday.</em></p>
