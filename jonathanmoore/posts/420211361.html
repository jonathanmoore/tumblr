<h2>Jackson Cole Moore</h2>
<p>Last Monday at 9:03am my wife and I welcomed our new little boy into our family, Jackson Cole Moore.  Although he surprised us by showing up two weeks early he was incredibly healthy and a big guy at 7 lbs, 13 oz and 19.5 inches long.  I posted <a target="_blank" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jonathan_moore/sets/72157623396750321/">on Flickr a photoset with more images</a> of the experience.</p>
<p>It was great to spend all of last week with family completely disconnected from work and the computer, but this week I&#8217;ll be shifting back into a work schedule and regular posts.</p>
