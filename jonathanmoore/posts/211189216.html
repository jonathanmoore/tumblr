<h2>Whale Song by Modest Mouse</h2>
<p>Bent Image Lab just completed this exceptionally dark and beautiful film for the indie-rock band Modest Mouse.  The piece merges live action, stop motion, visual effects and motion graphics to bring the mood of the song to life.</p>

<p><b>Video Concept:</b><br/>&#8221;<i>After entering his personal sanctuary, an artist is presented with a hand-crafted drawing tool that assists him in materializing his mental impressions. The machine discharges his thoughts as an endless web of yarn that guides him through his physical thoughts. The story progresses to reveal that he is divided between two worlds, one of dull reality and the second of warped memories. In the process of finding a way out of his consciousness, he is trapped between the two competing spaces, which eventually inflict lethal damage, acting as metaphors to self-destruction.</i>&#8221;</p>
