<p><span>I’m delighted to announce that we’ve reached an agreement to acquire Tumblr! </span></p>
<p>We promise not to screw it up.  Tumblr is incredibly special and has a great thing going.  We will operate Tumblr independently.  David Karp will remain CEO.  The product roadmap, their team, their wit and irreverence will all remain the same as will their mission to empower creators to make their best work and get it in front of the audience they deserve.  Yahoo! will help Tumblr get even better, faster.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am feeling quite optimistic that Yahoo is going to get it right with Tumblr and “not screw it up”.  Congrats to David Karp and the entire Tumblr team.</p>
<p>With <a href="http://stylehatch.co" target="_blank">Style Hatch</a> will continue to stay focused on making the best Tumblr themes available along with our stellar support and frequent updates!</p>
