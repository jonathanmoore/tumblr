<h2>Rdio - Social Music</h2>
<p>For years I subscribed to Rhapsody but eventually lost interest because of the lack of social features in communities like <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/newezra" target="_blank">Last.fm</a>.  In fact because of this lack I even <a href="http://grooveroll.com/" target="_blank">explored creating an extension of Rhapsody</a> that would aggregate and share what you&#8217;re listening to (<em>now I need to find a good use for the domain - <a href="http://grooveroll.com/" target="_blank">grooveroll.com</a></em>).  A few weeks ago a new site <a href="http://rdio.com" target="_blank">Rdio</a> was launched that provides both an unlimited stream of music and social features that actually help me find new music and see what other people are playing.  As a bonus the UI and design is incredibly well done.</p>
<p>Right now Rdio is in private beta, and I currently have <strike>3 invites</strike> <em>no more invites</em> to the service.  If you&#8217;re interested in <strike>checking out Rdio let me know</strike> <em>simply saying hi</em> - <a href="mailto:jmoore@newezra.com" target="_blank">jmoore@newezra.com</a>  Rdio also has a Tumblr blog setup that you might want to follow - <a href="http://blog.rdio.com" target="_blank">blog.rdio.com</a></p>
