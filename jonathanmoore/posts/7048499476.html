<h2><strong>The Burning House</strong></h2>
<p>Part <a href="http://thingsorganizedneatly.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Things Organized Neatly</a> and part &#8220;OMG my house is burning!&#8221;, the new Tumblr blog <a href="http://theburninghouse.com/" target="_blank">The Burning House</a> interviews people asking them what would you grab on your way out if your house was burning.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If your house was burning, what would you take with you? It&#8217;s a conflict between what&#8217;s practical, valuable and sentimental. What you would take reflects your interests, background and priorities. Think of it as an interview condensed into one question.</p>
