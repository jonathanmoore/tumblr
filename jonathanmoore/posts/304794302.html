<h2>Skullcandy - Killer Headphones</h2>
<p>Founder of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.skullcandy.com/">Skullcandy</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/magazine/entrepreneur/2010/january/204384.html">Rick Alden </a><i><a target="_blank" href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/magazine/entrepreneur/2010/january/204384.html">Entrepreneur</a></i><a target="_blank" href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/magazine/entrepreneur/2010/january/204384.html"> magazine&#8217;s Entrepreneur of 2009</a>, talks about the birth of the action sports brand.  After noticing a wall of generic black and silver headphones in every electronics store Rick Alden started Skullcandy to appeal to snowboarders and skaters with unique headphones.  Started in 2003 the company experienced quite a few difficult patches as demand was high, but manufactures were reluctant to take on the risk of the unconventional product.  Now in 2009 the company is expected to reach $120 million in revenue.</p>
<p>It also appears that much of the success of the company can be credited to the internal culture.  A surf trip to Costa Rica for all the employees and families is always a great way to motivate a team to hit numbers.  In the interview with Entrepreneur magazine Rick gives a lot of credit to the support of his wife.  Strong <a target="_blank" href="http://monicamoore.tumblr.com">support from a wife</a> is an incredible asset.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alden says his wife made it an easy leap: &#8220;Her response was, &#8216;Listen, the worst thing that could possibly happen is the business fails, and we start all over again. That&#8217;s just not that bad.&#8217; "</p>
