<p>As long as you can weed through the drastically over-written, buzzword oozing writing style, this is a fantastic article mapping out some broad trends in business for 2012.  Trend number seven should be of note for any designers or design focused brands:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Strategic differentiation begins with great design.</strong>  Strategic differentiation provides a desired reputation, creates a defensible competitive advantage, and influences preferential behaviors in the value chain.  In a market of rapid commoditization of products, shrinking product cycle times, and global delivery of services, organizations can barely create and sustain market differentiation.  [&#8230;]  Differentiation tools include positioning strategy, design thinking, and innovation program that drive next generation customer experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My translation without all the <a href="http://bullshitbingo.net/cards/buzzword/" target="_blank">buzzword bullshit</a> - <strong>Design matters. A lot. If you can provide an experience for you customers that delightfully surprises them, your brand will sit head and shoulders above the competition.</strong></p>
