<h2>Style Hatch Theme Updates</h2>
<p>We finally took the time to set aside three solid weeks to overhaul, perfect, and improve our <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/themes/by/jonathanmoore" target="_blank">eighteen premium Tumblr themes</a>.  Nearly <strong>200 todo items</strong> were crossed off the list and <strong>thousands of new lines of code</strong> were committed as we sweated over the details.  It was a tedious process, but we feel like we owe it to everyone who has bought one of our <a href="http://stylehatch.co" target="_blank">Style Hatch</a> themes.</p>
<p>Out of all the themes, <a href="http://swell.stylehatch.co" target="_blank">Swell</a> received the biggest update where I rewrote all of the Javascript that powers the theme.  The performance differences before and after are night and day.</p>
<p>Across <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/themes/by/jonathanmoore" target="_blank">all the themes</a>, we added support for Tumblr&#8217;s new video player for clips you upload, the ability to <a href="http://stylehatch.co/instagram" target="_blank">add your Instagram feed to your blog</a>, new social icons for Github, Instagram and Quora, and a lot of theme specific fixes and improvements.  </p>
<p><em>A big thanks goes to <a href="http://blog.dominicbutchello.com" target="_blank">Dominic Butchello</a> on the Tumblr team for quickly approving a flood of updates we submitted over the last few weeks. We&#8217;re on hand if you run into any issues with the updates - <a href="mailto:support@stylehatch.co" target="_blank">support@stylehatch.co</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/stylehatch" target="_blank">@stylehatch</a></em></p>
