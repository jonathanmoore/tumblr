<blockquote><p>I was never afraid to hire people better than me and let them do whatever they could do. … I look for the genius in the person, even if I didn’t like it. I want to see the fire that the person could do something which no one else could do, or that I couldn’t do, because myself, I did not need to duplicate. Naturally, these people are not usable, at least not right away. You have to find a way for the organization to adjust to talent – I don’t think talent should adjust to the organization.</p></blockquote>
<p><h2>Hartmut Esslinger, co-founder of Frog Design</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve personally seen situations where an organization becomes brave and hires talent doesn&#8217;t quite fit into the style and approach of the organization.  It is always unfortunate when it ends up not working out because the organization tries their best to make the talent fit their mold.</p>
