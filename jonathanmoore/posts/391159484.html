<h2>Design is Our Business</h2>
<p>In this lecture <a target="_blank" href="http://www.winwithoutpitching.com/founder">Blair Enns</a> challenges design firms to change the way that they view their business, services they provide and the way they position themselves.  You are either a producer firm, moving with the whims of the client and fulfilling their requests, or you are an expert firm, diagnosing, prescribing, and leading your client, giving them the strength to move forward.</p>
<p>Are you going to run a business that drowns in the sea of undifferentiated firms selling too similar services to too similar clients, or will you run a business that narrows your focus and deepens your expertise?</p>
