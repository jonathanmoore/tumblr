<blockquote><p>You’ll see fewer brands creating a site for one campaign and then throwing it away. Certainly we won’t do that at Unilever any more.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Decline of the Campaign Sites</h2>
<p>Both Coke-Cola and Unilever reveled that they are moving away from the concept of creating one-off campaign sites for every new product and initiative.  This will be a drastic shift from the current site throw away model.  Many interactive studios will resist and fight this change, but I honestly see this as an opportunity for innovation, producing some really exiting campaigns.  2010 will prove to be interesting.</p>
