<h2>Happiness Report</h2>
<p>37signals recently added three simple links at the bottom of each customer support email—“it was great :)”, “it was ok :|” and “it wasn&#8217;t good :(”.  The Happiness Report is then used to measure customer happiness <em>not satisfaction</em>, study the ratings to improve and provide full public transparency through their <a href="http://smiley.37signals.com/" target="_blank">happiness site</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>We strive for happiness — not satisfaction.</strong><br/>The customer service industry is obsessed with “customer satisfaction”. We believe that’s too low a bar. Satisfaction is not a measure of success — it’s just enough to get by. We want our customers to be happy. Happiness is success. Happiness is our goal.</p>

<p>Over the past few weeks I have been actively working to improve the support process for <a href="http://stylehatch.co/" target="_blank">Style Hatch</a>.  Between email, the theme feedback pages, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/stylehatch" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and people tracking me down and messaging me on my personal Facebook page I average close to <em>50 customer support requests a day</em>.  Rather than seeing the daily process as a chore I love surprising people with a fast—typically same day or less than 24 hours—and personal response.  Even when you have to let someone know that “the theme/Tumblr doesn&#8217;t support/work with _______” giving them a prompt and personal response often turns them into <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/stylehatch/favorites" target="_blank">brand evangelists</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Customer support is one of the most powerful tools in your company&#8217;s branding tool belt.</strong></p>
