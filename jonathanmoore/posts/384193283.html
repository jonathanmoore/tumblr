<blockquote><p>By not having the imagination to imagine what the content &#8220;might&#8221; be, a design consideration is lost. Meaning becomes obfuscated because &#8220;it&#8217;s just text&#8221;, understandability gets compromised because nobody realized that this text stuff was actually meant to be read. Opportunities get lost because the lorem ipsum garbage that you used instead of real content didn&#8217;t suggest opportunities. The text then gets made really small, because, it&#8217;s not meant to be used, we might as well create loads of that lovely white space.</p></blockquote>
