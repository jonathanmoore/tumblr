<p>I have to agree that <em>at times</em> rushed timelines for complex projects lead to frustrations and stress, but from my personal experience (and others that I&#8217;ve worked along side) <strong>a lot of my best work has come from aggressive timelines</strong>.  There is nothing like a fast approaching deadline that forces you to start making decisions and stop second guessing your creative methods.  In fact I have found that &#8220;slow design&#8221; tends to allow for too much time to contemplate, find inspiration, critique, adjust, and procrastinate.</p>
<p>The one situation where I believe aggressive timelines will produce frustration and poor work is when you allow or work in an environment where every project is a rush.  Once the burn-out kicks in it is near impossible to produce quality work quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Act fast. Create. Launch.</strong></p>
<p>What are your thoughts?  Do you believe &#8220;slow design&#8221; generally produces better work?</p>
