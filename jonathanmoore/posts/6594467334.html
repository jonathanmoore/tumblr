<h2><strong>Stuxnet: Anatomy of a Computer Virus</strong></h2>
<p>Fascinating and beautifully designed infographic on the recent Stuxnet virus that was used to cripple Iran&#8217;s nuclear enrichment facilities last summer.  With the design of the virus combined with stolen security clearances and twenty zero days holes, Stuxnet was able to cause some serious damage and set back Iran&#8217;s efforts.  Now that the virus is open-source and available for download, the question is who be the next to use Stuxnet with its capables of shutting down nuclear reactors or oil pipelines.</p>
<p>The direction and animation of this infographic was done by Australian motion designer <a href="http://patrickclair.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Patrick Clair</a> and written by Scott Mitchell</p>
