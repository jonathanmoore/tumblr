<blockquote><p>Oh that&#8217;s really cool! I&#8217;ve never heard of ppl using fb to do customer support!! Most just try to shove items in our face and expect us to buy things off fb!! Lol</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>- Cher C., in reply to Style Hatch&#8217;s support on <a href="http://facebook.com/stylehatch" target="_blank">Facebook</a> that we just rolled out</strong></p>
<p>If you or the brand you work with has &#8220;Facebook eCommerce page&#8221; anywhere our your social media strategy, you should fire your team.  Ok, that might be a bit harsh, but the truth is people interact with brands on Facebook to have a personal connection not have them &#8220;shove items in our face&#8221;.</p>
<p>Facebook and social media belong in the customer experience world, not &#8220;oh look we can sell our stuff there too&#8221;.</p>
