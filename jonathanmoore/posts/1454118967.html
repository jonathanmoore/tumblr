<blockquote><p>If you emerge from university today with a web design degree, chances are rather slim that you’re employable as a user experience (UX) or web designer. Maybe you learned a lot of stuff; it’s just probably the wrong stuff. Congratulations, you’ve been defrauded. Hope it didn’t cost you or your parents too much.</p></blockquote>
<p><h2>The UX Design Education Scam</h2>
<p>A well written article by <a href="http://www.andyrutledge.com/" target="_blank">Andy Rutledge</a> on <a href="http://www.andyrutledge.com/the-ux-design-education-scam.php" target="_blank">the disservice universities and higher educations are doing to students</a> going into user experience or web-related design.  I would much rather hire someone self-taught and motivated to learn over someone who spent years learning out-dated methods and technology.</p>
<p>This article addresses the problem head-on, and I could not agree more.  Read <a href="http://www.andyrutledge.com/the-ux-design-education-scam.php" target="_blank">The UX Design Education Scam</a>.</p>
