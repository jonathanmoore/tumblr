<blockquote><p>Perfectionism is not the key to success. In fact, research shows that perfectionism is correlated with depression, anxiety, addiction, and life paralysis or missed opportunities. The fear of failing of making mistakes, not meeting people’s expectations, and being criticized keeps us outside of the arena where healthy competition and striving unfolds.</p></blockquote>
