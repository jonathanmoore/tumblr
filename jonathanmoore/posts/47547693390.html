<h2><a href="https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/ef4772e3c628">Stop working (so hard)</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The idea that, without “hustle,” without throwing away nights and weekends, without putting your life on hold for your work, you’ll somehow be <em>more </em>successful, <em>more</em> productive, is ridiculous to me, yet continues to be pushed by participants in our industry left and right. This is, quite simply, insane.</p>
<p>So, dear reader, I implore you: If this post at all rings true, sounds a little too familiar, do yourself a favor — take a vacation. Get away from your work for a bit. Reset. And when you come back, pick some number under 35 and try working that many hours per week, and no more.</p>

<p>I could not agree more with these words of wisdom from Kyle Bragger.  When I left the interactive agency world to start Style Hatch I completely eliminated working on the weekends, on average I work less than 40 hours a week, rely on my team more, and frequent vacations with my family disconnected from work.  As a result my time in the office is far more focused and productive when I know that my day ends at 5pm.</p>
<p>Often I&#8217;m faced with that nagging urge to go back to putting in 80 hour weeks and out hustling the competition, but I would rather choose a pace that I can stick with for a lifetime while valuing time with my wife and three kids.</p>
<p>Work smarter not harder.</p>
