<p>Writer and editor <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/brucenussbaum" target="_blank">Bruce Nussbaum</a> presents the case that we are now entering the &#8220;Twilight of Pessimism for America&#8221; and finally moving beyond the notion that America is on the decline.  Although Nussbaum is writing specifically regarding the perception and attitude of Americans I believe that the same sense of optimism will be true in business, technology and the general view of the future.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beneath the noise of politics, the Know-Nothingism, the anger, the arrogance of belief and the corruption masquerading as lobbying, another culture is being built in cities where the future is more evenly distributed an far more optimistic. It is where political leaders really lead, Gen Yers build their lives on their own platforms and people wait for the bad movie that is Washington to end. I’m betting that in the decade ahead, the signal that is America&#8217;s comeback will grow stronger and replace the current noise.</p>

<p><strong>Here&#8217;s to a new optimistic year and era!</strong></p>
