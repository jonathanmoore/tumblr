<h2>Wake Up Early</h2>
<p>Excellent article from <a href="http://the99percent.com/" target="_blank">99 Percent</a> on how rising early to start your day will lead to better productivity and a greater sense of control over your day.</p>

<p>When I interview creatives, I often ask them what advice they would give to the next generation, the up-and-comers. Curiously, there’s one incredibly important habit that nearly all of them possess that is almost never mentioned. So what is the secret ingredient in their productivity regime? It’s simple: They get up early.</p>

<p>Over the next two weeks I&#8217;m going conduct an experiment and try several techniques to shift my schedule to early mornings verses late into the night, define a consistent work schedule, boost my focus on one thing at a time, and get better at keeping a todo list.  During this process I plan on writing about my personal reasons for the experiment, some of the techniques I&#8217;m trying and of course the results. <em>Wish me luck!</em></p>
