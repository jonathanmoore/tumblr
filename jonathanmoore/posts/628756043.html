<p><em>At the end of the article they give sound advice to others considering starting a business.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<ul><li>Don’t make excuses, start building something right now. Ideas are worthless unless they’re executed.</li>
<li>Never be afraid to charge for your product from day one. If nobody is prepared to pay for it, it’s probably not solving an important problem anyway.</li>
<li>Avoid additional investors if you can. There’s nothing more satisfying than being in complete control of your destiny.</li>
<li>Never lose sight of the fact that you’re starting a business to give you more freedom to do what you enjoy in life. Don’t let it consume the very thing you’re aiming to improve.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
