<blockquote>
<p>Social networking sites give us portals into another person&#8217;s (user&#8217;s) mind, so far as that person (user) makes public their thoughts, ideas, feelings and desires. At times, we are perhaps more honest online, and especially on social networks, than we are in real life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am pretty certain that we can all think of a few people where there seems to be a contradiction from their introverted persona in real live to their eager to share persona online.  This article looks at several recent psychology studies that help explain our ability to speak freely online.</p>
