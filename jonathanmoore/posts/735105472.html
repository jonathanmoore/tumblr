<h2>MDC&#8217;s &#8216;Million-Dollar Challenge&#8217;</h2>
<p>MDC Partners is the large holding company that owns a large percentage of today&#8217;s prominent advertising agencies including Crispin Porter + Bogusky, VITRO, mono, Kirshenbaum Bond Senecal &amp; Partners, and dozens of other agencies.  Today they are making waves in the agency world by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/25/business/media/25adco.html?adxnnl=1&amp;ref=media&amp;adxnnlx=1277481929-Es917IwYiAQIGmhUkeTjxA" target="_blank">offering up $1 million to fund a new start-up agency with a fresh business model, in exchange for 51% ownership of the new agency</a>.</p>
<p>The most shocking—although not surprising—detail revealed in the article is that <strong><em>MDC spent $1 million dollars to revamp their <a href="http://www.mdc-partners.com/" target="_blank">corporate website</a></em></strong>.  Working in the advertising world for the last decade I clearly understand what all goes into the budgeting of these projects—thousands of hours of meeting, planning, debating, holding committees, politics, and then a small percentage on the actual execution of the idea.  How can you dispute that $1 million dollars isn&#8217;t an insanely bloated budget for a site built on existing platforms and technology (Twitter, Brightkite, Google Maps, YouTube)?  This is a prime example of the challenges that large agencies are facing to stay relevant in our fast-paced digital culture.</p>
<p>Personally I believe building a vibrant and successful agency simply takes hard work and raw talent and throwing $1 million at a startup would change the motivation to work hard from success to performing to the standards that rewarded them the $1 million. The results of both motivations might appear similar, but there is no doubt that the motivation will ultimately effect the agency culture.</p>
