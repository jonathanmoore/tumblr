<h2><a href="http://jessicahische.is/talkingtype"> Upping Your Type Game</a></h2>
<blockquote class="link_og_blockquote"><span>I want to introduce you to your brother from another mother—another group of humans that, like you, is quite under-appreciated: the type designer. Type designers and web designers have an amazing amount in common, that’s why it’s super wonderful that they’ve been collaborating more lately. Web designers are pumped that they can use more than a handful of fonts on the internet, and type designers are pumped that this new group of people using their fonts actually know how to use computers.</span></blockquote>
<p>A wonderfully thorough and helpful guide to type design targeted towards web designers by <a href="http://jessicahische.is/" target="_blank">Jessica Hische</a>.</p>
