<h2><a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2012/08/the_disciplined_pursuit_of_less.html">Success is a catalyst for failure</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Why don&#8217;t successful people and organizations automatically become very successful? One important explanation is due to what I call &#8220;the clarity paradox,&#8221; which can be summed up in four predictable phases:</p>
<ul><li>Phase 1: When we really have clarity of purpose, it leads to success.</li>
<li>Phase 2: When we have success, it leads to more options and opportunities.</li>
<li>Phase 3: When we have increased options and opportunities, it leads to diffused efforts.</li>
<li>Phase 4: Diffused efforts undermine the very clarity that led to our success in the first place.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
