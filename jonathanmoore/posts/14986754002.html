<p>I think that social blogging platforms like Tumblr may see a huge growth in 2012. Your designs are helping lead the way in responsive and more customisable themes.</p>
<p>I no longer believe in web designers taking thousands of pounds to design a small biz web presence. Social is doing more to drive traffic, and I think it can stand up as strong as seo driving new customers.</p>

<p>An excerpt of a <a href="http://stylehatch.co" target="_blank">Style Hatch</a> support email we got earlier today.  Small businesses need for expensive, custom designed online presence is declining as more of them turn to platforms like <a href="http://tumblr.com" target="_blank">Tumblr</a>, <a href="http://virb.com" target="_blank">Virb</a>, <a href="http://squarespace.com" target="_blank">Squarespace</a> and others.</p>
<p>Highly skilled and strategic web designers and studios will always deliver value to small businesses, but <em>mediocre designers should be worried</em>.</p>
