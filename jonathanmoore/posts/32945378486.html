<h2><a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/10/todont.html">Todon't</a></h2>
<p>In response to the glut and excess of todo applications, Jeff Atwood makes the case for ditching the list&#8217;s “soul-draining exercises in reductionism”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s my challenge. <strong>If you can&#8217;t wake up every day and, using your 100% original equipment God-given organic brain, come up with the three most important things you need to do that day</strong> – then you should seriously work on fixing that. I don&#8217;t mean install another app, or read more productivity blogs and books. You have to figure out what&#8217;s important to you and what motivates you; ask yourself why that stuff isn&#8217;t gnawing at you enough to make you get it done. Fix that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For quite some time I have kept a simple, daily, mental (or sometimes handwritten) <em><strong>things to focus on</strong></em> list consisting of the three things that are priority for the day.  If I start to get off track or tackle projects that are not a priority for that day it&#8217;s a good reminder to get back on track.</p>
