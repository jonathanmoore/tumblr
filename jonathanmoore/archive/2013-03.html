<h2>Mexout</h2>

<p>Stellar branding, interior and graphic design work by Singapore based <a href="http://www.behance.net/bravocompany" target="_blank">Bravo Company</a> for the new Mexout eatery.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mexout is a fresh-mex eatery in Singapore. We imagine Mexout to be a young eccentric Mexican food expert, or “Mex’pert” as we’ve coined it, who is living in his parents’ basement. … We’ve came up with about 20 hand-drawn logos for them to use in rotation. For the rest of their collaterals, everything is handwritten or hand-drawn. No computer was used for the creation of the graphics.</p>

<p>Pricing has far more to do with physiology and the built in perception of value than simply going with an amount people are willing to pay.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>People were offered 2 kinds of beer: premium beer for $2.50 and bargain beer for $1.80. Around 80% chose the more expensive beer.</p>
  
  <p>Now a third beer was introduced, a super bargain beer for $1.60 in addition to the previous two. Now 80% bought the $1.80 beer and the rest $2.50 beer. Nobody bought the cheapest option.</p>
  
  <p>Third time around, they removed the $1.60 beer and replaced with a super premium $3.40 beer. Most people chose the $2.50 beer, a small number $1.80 beer and arounf 10% opted for the most expensive $3.40 beer. Some people will always buy the most expensive option, no matter the price.</p>
  
  <p>You can influence people’s choice by offering different options. Old school sales people also say that offering different price point options will make people choose between your plans, instead of choosing whether to buy your product or not.</p>

<blockquote><p>Perfectionism is not the key to success. In fact, research shows that perfectionism is correlated with depression, anxiety, addiction, and life paralysis or missed opportunities. The fear of failing of making mistakes, not meeting people’s expectations, and being criticized keeps us outside of the arena where healthy competition and striving unfolds.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>You know what is fun? Making things. Turning a spark of creative insight into a thing that you can show people — a thing that people can use and from which they can derive some iota of pleasure or utility. Start with a simple website. Basic HTML and CSS. No product is too small. In fact, the opposite is true. If you don’t know how to build the first version of your product in a weekend — a usable working version, don’t try to build it. Programming is a means to an end, not an end in itself. You should be trying to do as little of it as possible to make the thing that you want.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fastest way to make something is to simply start.  Don&#8217;t get caught in the never ending process of learning, researching, and over-thinking your idea.</p>

<blockquote><p>Don’t you just hate it when you urgently shoot an email to tech support - who guarantee they will get back to you asap - only to find that the guarantee of them getting back to “asap” you is via an automated confirmation email of having received your call for help. In such instances, we tend to forget that tech support are people too and that they need to go back home  :D  or just wish that they simply had someone “human” on call 24/7.</p>
<p>Well I wasn’t in such a dire situation with my call for help to <em>Style Hatch</em>. But my support request was emailed over the weekend and I obviously did not expect to get any help until the next day. But as expected, I received the above automated confirmation email. And reading the content of it just made me smile. A simple “automated” email had so much of “human touch” to it. It’s a rather small thing but I loved it that <em>Style Hatch</em> put so much care to add a word of reassurance that they will indeed get back to help me! Having read that email, I would have forgiven <em>Style Hatch</em> even if they weren’t able to get back to me because they had to continue<strong><em> ”fighting the sharks with their bare hands”.</em></strong></p></blockquote>

<p>Good design goes well beyond the pixels and typefaces all the way down to the small interactions that a customer has with your company.  <em>Now I better get back to wrestling sharks&#8230;</em></p>

<h2><a href="http://stylehatch.github.com/photoset-grid/">jQuery Photoset Grid</a></h2>
<p>The photoset option is up there as one of my favorite features on Tumblr, but the default photoset grid that Tumblr generates does not resize and play well with all of our <a href="http://stylehatch.co" target="_blank">Style Hatch</a> theme&#8217;s responsive layouts.  As a result we created our own resizable photoset grid jQuery plugin that we rolled out last year.</p>

<p>I recently took the time to clean up the plugin, write documentation, and put together a demo showing how it works.  The <a href="http://stylehatch.github.com/photoset-grid/" target="_blank">jQuery photoset grid plugin</a> can be integrated into Tumblr themes, but it&#8217;s designed to work outside of Tumblr as well.</p>

<p>Feel free to <a href="https://github.com/stylehatch/photoset-grid/" target="_blank">open issues, fork it, and submit pull requests</a>!</p>
