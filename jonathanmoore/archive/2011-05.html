<h2><strong>Hey You! What Song are you Listening to?</strong></h2>
<p>Ever wonder what everyone&#8217;s listening to as you walk around NYC?  Youtuber Tyler Cullen decided to ask random New Yorkers with headphones on what song they are listening to.</p>
<h3><strong>Rdio Playlist</strong></h3>
<p>For your listening enjoyment quickly put together an Rdio playlist with all the tracks mentioned in the video.  I was pleasantly surprised that their growing library had all 21 tracks.</p>

<h2>Idler—Modular Typeface Family</h2>
<p>This new typeface from <a href="http://www.lamesville.com/" target="_blank">Lamesville</a> and availible on <a href="http://www.youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=T1770" target="_blank">You Work For Them</a> comes in six different weights that can be layered up and colored to create interesting styles and effect.  This well animated video walks you through three examples of how the font can be used.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Idler is an all caps, modular display typeface meant to be used for big, bold lettering. Idler&#8217;s two &#8220;main&#8221; weights (Idler Detail and Idler Plain) can be used effectively as single colored layers on their own, but the typeface&#8217;s true potential is realized when the user layers the &#8220;shaded&#8221; weights along with the main weights to create a colorful 3D shading effect. The Idler family contains six weights all together: Idler Detail, Idler Plain, Idler Inner, Idler Highlight, Idler Shadow, &amp; Idler Solid.</p>

<h2><strong>Lost Type Co-op</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://losttype.com/" target="_blank">Lost Type Co-op</a> is a collaboration between Tyler Galpin and Riley Cran. It was founded with the intention of providing unique and quality fonts based on a pay-what-you-want model. All designers get 100% of the donations their font receives. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Over the past few months I&#8217;ve been able to have a few good conversations with the up-and-coming designer <a href="http://galp.in/" target="_blank">Tyler Galpin</a>, and his story is quite inspiring.  Almost a year ago Tyler was working in at a bank in Canada wrangling spreadsheets and pursuing a career in finance.  At the same time he was trying to balance out his career with a passion for design.  One day while working on an insanely large spreadsheet it hit him that he should change course and dive head-first into what he loves—design.  </p>
<p>Through serious networking, hard work, raw talent and becoming <a href="http://dribbble.com/tylergalpin" target="_blank">incredibly active in the design community</a> his career in design took off.  Keep an eye on Tyler.</p>
<p>To sum it up, <strong>don&#8217;t waste time doing anything other than what you love</strong>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Do what you think is right and apologize later.</p></blockquote>
<p>Excellent quote from Scott Wilson&#8217;s, founder of <a href="http://www.mnml.com/" target="_blank">MINIMAL</a> and creator of the <a href="http://mnml1.posterous.com/redrun-lunatik-is-here" target="_blank">LunaTik</a>, boss Ed Boyd while working at Nike.  Go to The 99 Percent and read the full article—<em><a href="http://the99percent.com/articles/7011/Scott-Wilson-Do-What-You-Think-Is-Right-Apologize-Later" target="_blank">Scott Wilson: Do What You Think Is Right &amp; Apologize Later</a></em> on design, entrepreneurship and taking risks—in fact I think I should read it again.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My boss at Nike, Ed Boyd, told me: “Do what you think is right and apologize later.” That really gave me free rein. And I fell in love with that culture and way of doing things. It’s very entrepreneurially focused. There’s a lot of people at Nike, they go under the radar, and they incubate something, and then they spring it on you.  </p>
<p>Nike really opened my eyes about how you actually talk to a consumer, and how you craft a story.</p>

<h2>Tower House by Andersson-Wise</h2>
<p>Austin architects <a href="http://www.anderssonwise.com/" target="_blank">Andersson-Wise</a> did an amazing job on this modern and natural tower house on the water outside of Austin, Texas.  I could definitely live here.  One day in the future I would love to be able to hire an architect to custom design a home full a character.</p>

<h2><strong>GMUNK—Tron Visual Graphics</strong></h2>
<p>Recently the motion graphics pioneer <a href="http://work.gmunk.com/" target="_blank">Bradley G Munkowitz&#8217;s, GMUNK</a>, updated his portfolio with eight case studies for the visual graphics and eye-candy work that he lead for Tron.  Each of the projects show multiple renders, behind the scenes elements, and beautiful screenshots of the work.   </p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the entirety of 2010, munkowitz led a black-ops team of GFX all-stars deep into the darkness at <a href="http://www.digitaldomain.com/" target="_blank">Digital Domain</a> crafting over 12 minutes of holographic content for the feature film Tron</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Back in the early 2000s I remember being <a href="http://work.gmunk.com/#867362/FINN" target="_blank">blown away</a> by GMUNK&#8217;s work.  In fact his work, along with other up and coming interactive and motion designers, was one of my major influences in perusing design.</p>
<p><em>Bonus points to anyone who makes an animated GIF of his <a href="http://work.gmunk.com/#875741/Mandingo-Immortal" target="_blank">Mandingo Immortal project</a>.  I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;ll be an instant Tumblr hit.</em></p>

<h2><strong>Swell 1.0 Launch &amp; Style Hatch Update</strong></h2>
<p>Finally, the latest <a href="http://stylehatch.co" target="_blank">Style Hatch</a> <a href="http://swell-theme.tumblr.com" target="_blank">premium theme, Swell</a> is live!  Although the design is a bit more on the simplistic side there is an insane amount of detail that went into the build and overall experience.  Early next week I&#8217;ll write up a post going into the details of how I pull off some of the more intense features.  For now, here&#8217;s an overview of some of my favorite features:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Infinite scrolling &amp; lightbox post view</strong> - One of the things I don&#8217;t like about most infinite scrolling sites is scrolling down several pages, clicking on a post, and going back to find that I lost where I&#8217;m at.  To get around this in Swell I introduced a lightbox style post viewer.  With the viewer the page never has to refresh or update as you&#8217;re browsing.</li>
<li><strong>Deep linking and browser history</strong> - As you&#8217;re going through the posts you will notice that the URL updates with post hashbangs (<a href="http://swell-theme.tumblr.com/#!/post/5649171891/water-changes-everything" target="_blank">/#!/post/5649171891/water-changes-everything</a>) that allow you to copy and paste the URLs.  Plus this allows for the browser to track your history so that you can use the back / forward buttons.</li>
<li><strong>Keyboard shortcuts</strong> - Browse the posts by hitting J/K to go next/back and ESC to close the window.</li>
<li><strong>Description reveal</strong> - Rather than cluttering the page with the site description, recent tweets, liked posts, Flickr posts, etc all of those features are hidden at the top of the site in a reveal.  You can click the top right triangle, about link in the header, or browse to (<a href="http://swell-theme.tumblr.com/#!/about" target="_blank">/#!/about</a>) to see the reveal.</li>
<li><strong>Typekit</strong> - Like all the other Style Hatch themes this one includes full Typekit support allowing you to set the title, body and UI fonts.</li>
</ul><h3><strong>Swell Updates</strong></h3>
<p>After seeing <a href="http://cinthieyeater.com/" target="_blank">real-world usage</a> of Swell I already have a growing list of tweaks and improvements for the theme.  Most of them are focused on increasing performance so that the theme is lightning fast when hundreds of posts are on the page at once.  Across all the Style Hatch themes I&#8217;ve pushed live nearly 100 updates, so this is only the beginning.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, ideas or issue email me personally at <a href="mailto:swell@stylehatch.co" target="_blank">swell@stylehatch.co</a>.  I always try to get to emails within a day with the exception of weekends and holidays.</p>
<h3><strong>Giving Back</strong></h3>
<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/22566556?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="580" height="326" frameborder="0"></iframe>
<p>At the beginning of May I decided to start taking a portion of each theme&#8217;s sales to give back and help do good in developing countries.  Now, for every 5 themes sold 1 person will be given access to clean water through <a href="http://www.charitywater.org/" target="_blank">Charity Water</a>.  At the close of the month I will share more details, including the ability to track and see specific freshwater projects that were made possible through Style Hatch.  I really hope that this doesn&#8217;t come across as a marketing gimmick.  Honestly I&#8217;m extremely excited to give back to something that makes a real difference.  <strong>Already hundreds of people will be helped.</strong>  <a href="http://www.charitywater.org/whywater/" target="_blank">Learn more about what Charity Water is doing—Why Water</a>?</p>
<h3><strong>The Future of Style Hatch</strong></h3>
<p>There is a lot going on behind the scenes with <a href="http://stylehatch.co" target="_blank">Style Hatch</a> right now as I&#8217;m working to launch even more <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/themes/by/jonathanmoore" target="_blank">premium Tumblr themes</a> and move to other platforms (<em>no plans for Wordpress themes</em>).  On Monday <a href="http://blog.jessbrown.me/" target="_blank">Jess Brown</a>, my first full-time employee, starts working with me at New Ezra and Style Hatch.  His official role will be the director of customer experience which will cover support, outreach, as well as many other things.  <strong>The future is extremely bright!</strong></p>

<h2>Designing for Love—ESPN.com Refresh</h2>
<p>The insanely talented <a href="http://portfolio.tofslie.com/" target="_blank">Edwin Tofslie</a> recently decided to create a<a href="http://portfolio.tofslie.com/#1471241/ESPN-com-Refresh" target="_blank"> full refresh of ESPN.com</a> after getting sick of their dull and outdated site.  Although this was a &#8216;just for the love of design&#8217; project, it&#8217;s a good reminder to take the time to go through similar design exercises to keep your creative mind sharp.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My inspiration really came from ESPN the Magazine. I really believe the merging of magazine layout and website content will continue to blur the lines. I especially believe if I were to tackle this as a real project, it would have to be designed, and built to scale and spider to any platform, in any form. This would allow a specialized iPad version of their site that would mimic a powerful interactive magazine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After checking out the details and larger images on the <a href="http://portfolio.tofslie.com/#1471241/ESPN-com-Refresh" target="_blank">ESPN.com redesign</a>, spend some time looking at his other projects for Nike, Microsoft, Ford and others.  Don&#8217;t forget to hit refresh a few times to check out his collection of animated GIFs.</p>
<p><em>Now I just need to figure out a site that could use a refresh and do the same.</em></p>

<p>Seeing this makes me want to go back to my mid-2000s days at <a href="http://2advanced.com" target="_blank">2Advanced</a> and dust off After Effects and C4D&#8217;s <a href="http://www.maxon.net/products/cinema-4d-studio/3d-motion-graphics.html" target="_blank">Mograph module</a>.</p>

<h2><strong>Anatomy of a Mashup:<br/>Definitive Daft Punk visualized</strong></h2>
<p>Web technologist <a href="http://themaninblue.com/writing/perspective/2011/05/12/" target="_blank">Cameron Adams</a> recently created a mashup of 23 Daft Punk songs titled Definitive Daft Punk.  Like any good music mashup as you&#8217;re listening it becomes easy to get lost in the track and figure out where one track begins and ends.  To illustrate the layering and composition Cameron created this <a href="http://daftpunk.themaninblue.com/" target="_blank">killer HTML5 and CSS3 visualization of the mashup</a>.  <em>Make sure you view it in a modern browser like Chrome or Safari.</em></p>

<h2><a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2904-forget-passion-focus-on-process">Forget Passion, Focus on Process</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Find meaning in what you’re doing. Work to improve your industry. Get joy from making a customer’s day. Surround yourself with the kinds of people and environment that keep you engaged. Figure out the details and day-to-day process that keep you stimulated. Focus on how you execute and making continual improvements. Get off on how you sell, not what you sell.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Process is what motivates me and moves me forward.  Product launches are fun and full of energy, but it the tweaking and refining of the process and customer experience where you will see the most gains.  </p>
<p><strong>Like quality over quantity, put process over passion.</strong></p>

<h2><strong>Paper Record Player</strong></h2>
<p><a href="http://kellianderson.com/" target="_blank">Kelli Anderson</a> just pulled off what might be the coolest wedding invite ever created with a paper record player included that plays a song written by the groom and bride.  With a bit of paper folding the invite booklet reveals a needle that plays a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexi_disc" target="_blank">flexi disc record</a>.  If I ever received an invite even close to this one I would feel obligated to buy them an amazing wedding present.</p>
<p>Get inspired looking at all of <a href="http://www.kellianderson.com/projects/" target="_blank">Kelli&#8217;s amazing work</a>.</p>

<h2><strong>Hope, Fear and Digital Culture</strong></h2>
<p>Only 30 years ago people did not make things.  They would go to art galleries, buy records, read books by famous authors, and watch Hollywood movies all created by professional artists.  Fast forward to the last decade—<em>especially the last few years—</em>and everything we know about consuming and creating has unraveled.  The makers dramatically changing industries and the world forever.</p>
<p>Today everyone makes things.  Not only has the digital age allowed people to become curators of culture, it has removed all the barriers for anyone to create.  Everyone is a photographer, writer, designer, musician, film maker.  Despite a recession there has never in history been a better time to create and find success as an artist.</p>
<p>The new documentary <a href="http://www.presspauseplay.com/" target="_blank">PressPausePlay</a> explores the concept of hope, fear and digital culture in today&#8217;s society.</p>
<h3><strong>Ideas that Spread Win</strong></h3>
<p>In the clip above author <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/" target="_blank">Seth Godin</a> talks about his experience as an author and his decision to release his book <a href="http://www.sethgodin.com/ideavirus/" target="_blank">Unleashing the Idea Virus</a> online for free without his publisher.  Since the free ebook was released online it has been downloaded over five million times and lead to a hardcover version that topped Amazon&#8217;s best seller charts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I made more money from the book that I gave away than the one I had sold.  The lesson is&#8230; this changes everything. The industry is dead.<br/><strong>- Seth Godin</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>What are you going to do?</strong></h3>
<p>Personally I decided to take a leap of faith in early 2009 leaving the ad agency world behind with the goal of being able to find happiness in creative work that I control, provide for my family, and grow a business that <a href="http://jonathanmoore.com/post/5138107232/this-week-is-going-to-be-a-good-wee" target="_blank">gives back to society and employs other talented people</a>.  It took several months of ad agency contracts and client work, but finally in late 2010 I was able to transition from clients to truly being independent.  For the first time in my career I feel like I have full creative control over what make or pursue.</p>
<p>Best of all getting to this point didn&#8217;t require any luck, special favors or a pile of cash.  It was accomplished through <strong>seeing an opportunity and acting on it</strong> with a bit of hard work. I strongly believe that there is no reason why anyone else couldn&#8217;t do the same in this amazing time we live in.</p>
<p>With all of this opportunity to create and get paid for it, how are you going to take advantage of the moment?</p>

<p><strong>This week is going to be a good week.</strong>  I&#8217;m extremely excited to reveal details on all three later this week—especially the &#8216;giving back&#8217; portion.  Starting yesterday, May 1, a significant portion of <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/themes/by/jonathanmoore" target="_blank">every Style Hatch premium Tumblr theme</a> sold goes directly to funding clean water projects across the globe.  For quite some time it has been my goal to integrate giving into each of the companies started under <a href="http://newezra.com" target="_blank">New Ezra</a>, including <a href="http://stylehatch.co" target="_blank">Style Hatch</a>.  Now it is a reality!</p>
